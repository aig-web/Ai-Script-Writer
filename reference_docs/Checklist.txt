### Viral Instagram Reel Script Checklist

Use this checklist to refine your Instagram Reel script and optimize for viral potential:

---

#### **1. Start with a Strong Hook**
- [ ] Use a **split-screen format** or visually engaging layout for the first 3 seconds.
- [ ] Feature the **most exciting or intriguing visuals** at the top section.
- [ ] Ensure the opening moment is captivating:
  - [ ] **Text**: Compelling caption or on-screen text.
  - [ ] **Audio**: Intriguing sound or voice.
  - [ ] **Visuals**: Attention-grabbing imagery.

---

#### **2. Prioritize Content Over Creator**
- [ ] Focus on delivering value, entertainment, or curiosity—not just personal brand presence.
- [ ] Craft the script to answer: “Why should viewers care?”

---

#### **3. Limit Full-Screen Speaking Shots**
- [ ] Avoid prolonged face-on-camera shots, especially in the first 30–40 seconds.
- [ ] Incorporate dynamic visuals, such as:
  - [ ] Quick cuts.
  - [ ] B-roll footage.
  - [ ] On-screen graphics or animations.

---

#### **4. Add Retention Triggers**
- [ ] Insert a hook that promises value at the end (e.g., “Wait until the end to discover…”).
- [ ] Ensure the payoff matches the viewer’s curiosity or expectation.

---

#### **5. Conclude with Impactful Insights (Briefly)**
- [ ] Dedicate the last 10–15 seconds to highlight:
  - [ ] Why the content matters.
  - [ ] Practical takeaways or benefits for viewers.

---

#### **6. Create a Loop**
- [ ] Place the “Follow me” prompt **5 seconds before the end**—not as the closing statement.
- [ ] End with a seamless transition back to the start to encourage looping and replays.

---

#### **7. Optimize for Shares and Retention**
- [ ] Review your script to encourage **sharing** (e.g., relatable or surprising content).
- [ ] Aim for at least:
  - 15+ seconds retention from non-followers in the first 24 hours.
  - A share rate >1% within the first 24 hours.

---

#### **8. Test and Iterate**
- [ ] Create **three variations** of your script, each with:
  - Different hooks (text, visuals, or voiceovers).
- [ ] Use Instagram’s testing tools to evaluate performance and refine based on data.


---

#### **Bonus: Insights from Viral Examples**
- [ ] Watch time >18 seconds = better algorithmic boost.
- [ ] Aim for content that triggers curiosity or emotional sharing.
