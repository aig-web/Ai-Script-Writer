Samay Raina’s Latent app
Hook 1:
Samay raina is a pure marketing genius. what he just did blew my mind.
Hook 2 :
Samay Raina beat Netflix and Hotstar with just one Instagram story.
He casually dropped an app for his show "India Got Latent" and it instantly became the most
downloaded entertainment app in India. But here's what's fascinating - people are going crazy
to download an app to watch something that's already free on YouTube.
The psychology behind this? Pure genius.
His show is already crushing it with 20 million views per episode. Why? Because he does
what TV networks won't. Poonam Pandey as judge, Rakhi Sawant uncensored, guests TV
channels wouldn't dare touch - pure, raw, unfiltered content.
So when he simply posted "Hey, dropped an app for the show," people went crazy. They knew
what that meant: if the YouTube show is this spicy, imagine what's in the app's exclusive
section.
This isn't random. It's called the Velvet Rope Effect.
Within 24 hours, he hit number one on the App Store. No marketing campaigns. No
promotions. Just one story.
Look at the contrast:
Netflix begs "Please download our app"
Hotstar shouts "We have IPL!"
Samay just whispers "Want more Latent?"
Boom. Number one.

The psychological masterpiece? Three triggers:
People were already addicted to the free content
He promised exclusive access
He created FOMO without even trying
While others spend millions on marketing, he made his free show so good that people are
fighting to pay for more. All he had to say was "app's live."
Hit follow for more psychology insights nobody's talking about. Save this marketing
masterclass for later.
Milaf Cola
Hook 1 : This startup just turned fruit into drink which has become Coca-Cola's biggest
competition.
Hook 2 : Gen Z is abandoning Coca-Cola, and this ancient fruit based drink is the reason why.
For the first time in 137 years, Coca-Cola is actually scared of a competitor.
And it's not Pepsi.
Now here is the crazy part, this drink is made entirely from DATES.
Yes, the fruit. They've turned dates into a cola that people are calling 'liquid sunshine' - with
zero added sugar.
Saudi Arabia just backed this with 2.5 billion dollars, and they're selling it for just 70 cents per
can. Gen Z is already loving it - 33% are ditching sugary sodas completely.
But here's why I'm actually sharing this - this is HUGE for India. With companies like
Reliance's Campa Cola and new startups, we have a massive opportunity.

Think about it: India is becoming more health-conscious than ever. We have the
manufacturing capability, the market size, and guess what? We even have our own date
farms.
And here's the best part - with Zepto, Blinkit, and other quick commerce platforms, any new
beverage brand can reach millions of Indians in minutes.
The next big natural cola brand could come from India. For entrepreneurs watching this - the
blueprint is right here.
The market is ready. Follow for more game-changing business opportunities.
Kunal Bahl
Hook 1
Meet the shark of sharks, Kunal Bhal who turned 50 lakhs into 200 plus crores and then
invested in over 280 startups.
Here is his crazy story and why i think he is the real deal
In 2010, he started with a simple idea.
Hook : 2
This new Shark turned 50 lakhs into 200 plus crores.
Post that he invested in over 280 startups and god knows how much money he has made !
He is the Shark of all the sharks. Here is why.
But before that you need to know his crazy story
Meet Kunal Bahl.
In 2010, he started with a simple idea. A website selling daily deals and discount coupons

But then he made a bold move that changed everything. He completely transformed his
business model.
Turned his company Snapdeal into an e-commerce giant.
And guess what ? It worked. The company exploded in growth. Hit a massive 54,000 crore
valuation.
While everyone was focused on his success with Snapdeal, Kunal was quietly making
another move.
He spotted a small startup that nobody believed in. His investment? Just 50 lakhs in a
company called Ola Cabs.
Here's where it gets crazy. That one 50 lakh investment? Turned into over 200 crores. But
Kunal wasn't done. This was just the beginning.
Through his fund Titan Capital, he went on to spot unicorns before anyone else. Razorpay
before it became huge. Mamaearth before it became a household name. Urban Company
before it revolutionized services.
Today's numbers? Mind-blowing. He's backed more than 280 startups. More than any other
shark on the show. Many giving 100x returns to him
What makes him different? He's been in the founder's and investors' shoes both.
From founding Snapdeal to becoming Shark Tank India's most experienced investor. This is
why they call him the Shark of Sharks.

Mukesh Ambani’s 1l crores land
Hook 1:
This land is worth 1L crores but Ambani bought it for just 2200 crores and that too legally
Hook 2:
Ambani bought 100,000 crore rupees worth of land for just 2,200 crore rupees.
And he did it legally!
Here is the crazy story of how he made it happen.
instead of buying the land directly, Ambani made a genius move.
He bought 74 percent stake in a company called NMIIA, at just 28.50 rupees per share which
owned the land.
Now here's where it gets interesting.
This massive 5,286-acre land in Navi Mumbai sits next to a new international airport, India's
largest port, the Atal Setu, and the Mumbai-Pune Highway.
The masterstroke? Reliance had already invested 6,162 crore rupees in this project, making
them the largest creditor. So when CIDCO waived its first right of refusal, the deal was sealed.
Think about it: Land worth 100,000 crore rupees, acquired for just 2,200 crore rupees, through
perfect corporate planning. This could be Mukesh Ambani's greatest chess move yet.
The question everyone's asking: What is Reliance planning to do with land bigger than 4,000
football fields?

Ambani killed Dunzo
Mukesh Ambani killed Dunzo
He did by investing over 2000 crores in the company
Everyone thought Ambani lost money on Dunzo.
But let me show you his evil genius masterplan with which he made 10s of thousands of
crores
Let's look at step 1 of Ambani's trap.
Find a desperate company.
Invest 2000 crores.
Get a board seat.
Access all data.
Simple. Right?
But wait. It gets better.
Here's where Ambani showed his 200 IQ moves.
First. He blocked other investors.
Then. Refused to lower valuation.
Next. Set impossible targets.
And watched them burn 100 crores every month.
While everyone thought he was losing money.
He was actually executing his master plan.
Want to know what Ambani REALLY got for 2000 crores?
Complete market research.
Best talent pool.
Customer data worth thousands of crores.
Competitor's playbook.
Tech stack insights.
And then. Came the master stroke.
While Dunzo was dying:
JioMart grew 400 percent.
They copied their best features.
Hired their top talent.
Took their market share.
Ambani wasn't failing.
He was feasting.
Need proof?
Dunzo went from 2000 to just 50 employees.
All founders resigned.
18 months of unpaid salaries.
Meanwhile. JioMart?
Became a 80,000 crore giant.
This wasn't just business.

This was Ambani's Art of War.
Remember this.
Sometimes the biggest companies don't compete.
They invest.
And eliminate.

breakdowns.
House in Italy
You can buy this house in Italy for just 85 rupees.
Not just this home, even this , this and 100s more ( show a ton of beautiful homes of italy )
No, this isn't clickbait.
Italian towns are literally selling beautiful houses for the price of your chai. But the reason why
they are doing it is genius.
See, hundreds of beautiful Italian villages are slowly becoming ghost towns. Young people are
leaving for big cities. And thousands of historic homes are sitting empty. These aren't just any
homes. We're talking about centuries old Italian architecture.
But here's where it gets interesting. These towns came up with a genius plan. They're selling
homes to anyone in the world. Including Indians. For just 85 rupees.
Now here's the plot twist. You'll need about 20 to 40 lakhs for renovations. And you must
finish them in 3 years. But here's what most people don't know.
These towns are actually helping buyers. You get free architectural guidance. Fast tracked
permits. Tax benefits for 5 years. And some towns even offer extra incentives for young
families.
Let me tell you about Rahul ( name changed ) from Mumbai. He bought one of these homes
last year. Spent 25 lakhs on renovations. And he earns 1.5 lakhs monthly through Airbnb.

But that's not all. You can use these homes for remote work. Hello, European time zone
clients. Or start a tourism business. Maybe plan for retirement. Or just have your dream Italian
vacation home.
What a win win strategy right?
Would you be keen to grab one? Let me know

Apple Tax
Hook 1 :
Every iphone user is paying a hidden tax that arent aware of.
Its called apple tax and it means you could be paying upto 100% more while buying the exact
same product vs android or web
Let me show you proof
Hook 2 :
If you're using an iPhone, you're paying up to 124% more for the exact same products.
The reason? The Hidden Apple Tax!
Let me show you proof.
The exact same 500 grams of grapes on Zepto costs 65 rupees on Android and 146 rupees
on iPhone.
But it's not just groceries.

On Flipkart, a Mokobara suitcase shows up at 4,119 rupees with a 65% discount on Android.
The exact same suitcase on iPhone? 4,799 rupees with only a 60% discount.
And this is happening everywhere.
Ola and Uber charging more for the same route. Travel websites showing higher prices for the
same flights. All because you're using an iPhone.
Why is this happening?
Two major reasons.
First, the Apple Tax - every time you make a purchase through an iPhone app, Apple takes
30% while Android takes 15%. And companies pass these charges directly to you.
Second, Companies see iPhone users as premium customers.
They assume if you can afford an iPhone, you can afford to pay more. So they show you
higher prices and smaller discounts, all based on your phone choice.
The solution?
Always check prices on both Android and iPhone before purchasing.
Don't let companies charge you more just because of your phone choice.
Save this information - it might just save you from paying the Apple Tax. Follow for more
insightful breakdowns!

Puma recovery
A footballer threw these 20 thousand rupee Puma boots in the dustbin during a live match.
What Puma did next was absolute genius.
This could have been a complete disaster. Chelsea star Cucurella slipped twice wearing these
brand new Puma boots, costing his team two goals. In front of millions watching live.
He didn't just change the boots - he ran to the bench mid-game, ripped them off, and later
posted a photo of them in the trash.
Think about this: Millions of people just watched a professional footballer throw your premium
product in the dustbin. Sales could have crashed overnight.
But Puma's response? Brilliant.
Within 24 hours, they posted a "Caution: Wet Floor" sign with Cucurella's signature bushy
hair, and one perfect caption: "It's not how you slip, it's how you bounce back."
The internet exploded. Even rival players couldn't help but share it. A PR nightmare turned
into marketing gold overnight.
The story gets even better - Cucurella scored his first Premier League goal in his next match,
wearing Puma boots. You couldn't script it better.
For marketers watching this - sometimes your biggest crisis can become your biggest
opportunity. It's all about how you respond.
Follow for more genius marketing moves that turn disasters into gold.

Tamil Nadu women empowerment
hook1- This Indian state has more working women than any other state
Hook2- This Indian state is leading women empowerement?
The crazy part? They were invited by Davos to teach the world how they're making it
happen.
Davos is the world's most exclusive economic forum where billionaires, world leaders,
and top CEOs meet to shape global policies. Even getting invited is HUGE.
Want to know which state?
Here's a hint... 43% of ALL women working in India's manufacturing sector are in this
ONE state alone. That's 6.79 lakh women.
It's TAMIL NADU.
While other states are still figuring it out, Tamil Nadu's crushing records. Their rural
areas? 35.5% women in workforce. That's 13% higher than their urban areas!
But here's what's mind-blowing... 64% of their women work in service and manufacturing,
when the national average is just 43%. And they ranked number 2 in India for
women-owned businesses!
No wonder they're launching Bullish on TN at Davos 2025, with 50 high-stakes meetings
lined up. From 7 AM to 10 PM, for 3 straight days.
When the world's biggest economic forum says "Come teach us your secrets"... you know
something special is happening.
Tamil Nadu isn't just participating in the global race... they're showing the world how it's
done.

Ikea strategy
Hook 1: If you think Ikea stores are badly located then you don’t know about the crazy
marketing tactic they have been using which ends up making you spend 40% more.
Hook 2: Ever Thought why are all the IKEA stores located on the outskirts of cities?
Their 'inconvenient' locations made them a $44 billion empire
Body:
IKEA's store locations aren't random - they're actually genius
Most companies fight for prime city locations, but IKEA does the opposite
The average IKEA store sits 45 minutes from city centers, surrounded by nothing but parking
lots and highways
This isn't a cost-cutting move - it's actually brilliant psychology. Here's how it works...
When you invest time and gas money to reach an IKEA, your brain activates something called
the 'sunk cost fallacy'
Your mind thinks: 'I've already spent so much effort getting here, I need to make this trip worth
it.' This makes you more likely to fill your cart with items you weren't planning to buy
But here's where IKEA's strategy gets even smarter...
They build massive showrooms in these locations - typically 300,000 square feet. The extra
space costs way less because land is cheaper outside cities
This means they can create entire room displays, letting you imagine the furniture in your
home, making you more likely to purchase
The result? IKEA's psychological strategy helped them build a $44 billion empire - by making
their stores harder to reach

The company's called Colossal Biosciences, and they're using genetic engineering and AI to
resurrect an extinct species.
Now you might be thinking - why mammoths? Why not dinosaurs?
Well, these weren't just giant furry elephants. They were Earth's natural climate engineers.
Here's what's wild. When mammoths roamed the Earth:
Their massive feet packed down snow, preserving the permafrost

They knocked down trees, preventing forest overgrowth
They basically kept the Arctic frozen
But when they disappeared, everything changed:
The ground got soft
Forests grew unchecked
The Arctic started melting
Our climate shifted dramatically
Now Colossal has a crazy plan to bring them back:
16 labs worldwide
Cutting-edge genetic tech
Advanced AI systems
And they're not just working on mammoths. They've created an mRNA vaccine that's already
saving modern elephants from a deadly virus.
They're saying by 2028, we could see actual woolly mammoths walking the Earth again,
helping fight climate change just like they did thousands of years ago.
This isn't science fiction anymore. It's happening right now.

breakthroughs through lucid dreams.
The only problem is that They couldn't control when these dreams happened.
The Halo changes everything.

lucid dreams on demand.

Imagine testing dangerous experiments, practicing any skill, or solving impossible problems -
all while sleeping safely in your bed.

2 Cr juice shop
This juice shop makes almost 2 crore rupees working just 4 hours a day.
Sounds impossible, right?
This Pune entrepreneur cracked the code, and its genius/
Most people work over 12 hours, fighting for the same customers.
But this guy? He did something completely different.
Instead of one big fancy shop, he started tiny portable juice counters near parks and running
tracks.
Here is where it gets interesting.
He only operates from 5 AM to 9 AM, when most shops are still closed. Targeting morning
joggers when they are craving something healthy.
And it gets better.
He did not stop at one counter.
He expanded to 60 plus locations. Each making 1000 rupees daily, with just 400 rupees in
costs, and 300 rupees for staff.
That is 300 rupees profit, per counter, per day, times 60 plus locations. The math is insane.

Let me break it down. 1.96 crore yearly revenue. 60 lakh pure profit. All from working just 4
hours daily.
Here is the real business lesson.
Success is not about working longer hours. It is about finding the right timing and the right
audience.

Selfie from space
Hook 1 :
Check this out - this youtuber built a satellite that takes your selfie while you're waving from
Earth.
Let me tell you how you can get a space selfie
Hook 2 :
this youtuber is building a personal satellite to take selfies from space
Crazy part is that you can use his satellite to take selfies of you too
Let me tell you how you can get a space selfie
But before that you should know about crazy tech he invented to make it happen
It's insane.
This is Mark, a former NASA engineer turned youtuber who's launching a satellite called
SATGUS that takes photos of you from space with Earth photobombing in the background.
Now in order to make the satellite functional, he had to solve a bunch of major challenges.
One is power - he designed special solar panels that can fully charge a phone 9 times in just
a 90-minute orbit.
But here's where it gets really crazy - he invented this reaction wheel system with three
spinning flywheels that lets the satellite rotate precisely in any direction without thrusters.
It's pretty nuts, but the craziest part of all is that he's been documenting the whole journey.

After 3 years of development, the satellite's about to launch into orbit in just a couple months.
The coolest part?
When it's up there, you'll be able to upload your photo, and it'll take your selfie from space

Hook1- Google, Microsoft, and Apple are leaving Bangalore. Their new destination? A city
that was barely on the tech map 10 years ago.
Hook2- Bangalore is losing its crown as India's Silicon Valley. And it's happening faster than
anyone predicted."
For 40 years, Bangalore was untouchable in India's tech scene. The undisputed king of
startups."
But in 2024, something changed. Startup funding dropped 19%. Traffic became unbearable.
Office rent? Through the roof."
Meanwhile, 650 km away, another city was silently building something massive. Not just
another tech hub. But a complete ecosystem."
Enter Hyderabad. T-Hub 2.0: A ₹1000 crore mega-project. World-class offices at half
Bangalore's prices. And here's the genius part..."
While Bangalore struggled with infrastructure, Hyderabad built wider roads, better metros, and
faster permits. The result?"
"Google, Microsoft, Uber - all moving their biggest R&D centers here. Startup funding? Up
156%. But here's what everyone missed..."

"It wasn't just about buildings or funding. Hyderabad's success comes down to one thing:
They didn't try to be the next Bangalore."
They created their own playbook. Focused on solving problems, not copying success. And
that's the billion-dollar lesson."
The next tech hub won't win by copying Silicon Valley. It'll win by solving tomorrow's problems.
What city do you think is next?"

Hybrid animals
Hook 1: Japan is creating these creatures in real
They are half human and half animal created in a lab.
The reason why japan is doing it would blow your mind.
Hook 2: This is crazy! ( Show images and bring them to life using AI to create a crazy hook )
What are you looking at right now are hybrids. They are part human and part animal.
And Japan just made it legal to create new creatures
The reason would blow your mind.
Let me explain
Scientists are combining human cells with animal embryos, creating something that's never
existed before in human history.
The ethics? Highly controversial. The potential? Absolutely mind-blowing.
You see Every single day, 17 people die waiting for organ transplants.
Over 100,000 people sit on waiting lists, watching their time run out. Countless families lose
hope, knowing help might not come in time.

But these hybrids could change everything. Here's exactly how it works.
First, scientists take an animal embryo. Then, they remove specific genes that control organ
development. Next, they insert human stem cells. Finally, they let it develop under strict
supervision.
The result? An animal that can grow human organs inside it. Perfect matches. Zero rejection
risk. No more endless waiting lists.
The world is completely divided on this. Some people call it unethical. Others say we're
playing God. Many fear what could happen if this goes wrong.
But Japan's rules are incredibly strict. No human brain development is allowed. No
reproductive experiments. The pure focus is on saving human lives.
Think about what this means. A child could get a new heart in weeks, not years. A mother
could receive a kidney without waiting for tragedy to strike. A father could survive because we
didn't give up.
The future isn't coming anymore. It's already here. And it's more sci-fi than anything we could
have imagined.
If this blows your mind like it did mine, hit follow for more groundbreaking science that's
changing humanity.
Pickleball
Hook1- Rich Indians are ditching cricket for a children's backyard game
You won't believe
In Mumbai, people are spending ₹15,000 per hour
Just to play this American kid's game from 1965.
And it's growing 400% faster than cricket in India.
Started with a bored family using broken equipment?
Hook2- The rich in Mumbai aren't playing golf anymore. They've switched to a sport that
started in someone's backyard. And it's making them richer.
This is how a backyard game became the status symbol of Rich India.

Body- In 1965, three dads in America couldn't find their badminton equipment. So they
improvised with ping pong paddles and a plastic ball. They called it Pickleball.
But here's the crazy part: India had ZERO courts for this sport until 2023.
Plot twist: Today, there are 1000+ courts. 70,000+ players. And 40-50 new courts are being
built every month.
But why is everyone obsessed?
Because unlike cricket or football, Pickleball lets you become a pro in months, not years. It's
easier on your body than tennis. And takes less time than golf.
The elite caught on quickly: Last year's championship had a 1 crore prize pool. Private clubs
are adding courts faster than ever. And CEOs are closing deals over Pickleball matches.
Here's what most people miss: This isn't just about sports. It's proof that sometimes the
biggest opportunities... Come from the most unexpected places.
Think about it: A game invented by bored dads... It is now India's fastest-growing luxury sport.
So next time someone tells you something is "just a silly trend" Remember: Every billion-dollar
industry started as someone's "crazy idea."

Seagliders
HOOK 1: These IIT Madras students built this 'flying boat' that travels at 500km/h. The crazy
part, very soon for just 600 rupees you can travel from Kolkata to Chennai in just 3 hours.

HOOK 2: this is a flying boat built by our very own IIT madras grads and it could change the
we will travel. It can take you from Kolkata to Chennai in just 3 hours at just 600 rupees.
Crazy part even Anand Mahindra is obsessed with these
HOOK 3: Imagine flying just above water to travel from Kolkata to Chennai for just Rs 600 in
just 3 hours . That's the cost of a movie ticket and popcorn!
Kolkata to Chennai in just 3 hours? That's what these revolutionary "flying boats" from
Waterfly Technologies promise to deliver.
But wait - these aren't boats or planes. They're "seagliders" that fly just 4 meters above water
using something called ground effect. Think of it as surfing on air cushions at speeds up to
500 km per hour! It also aims to offer ZERO carbon travel.By offering zero-carbon travel
options, these innovative vehicles not only reduce environmental impact but also provide a
compelling alternative to traditional modes of transport.
The craziest part?
Anand Mahindra himself is hyping them up, calling the design "stunning" and praising IIT
Madras for rivaling Silicon Valley in nurturing this startup.
You're probably thinking this is just another fancy concept that'll never happen, right? Wrong!
They already have a working prototype and by April 2025, a 100 kg version will be ready. By
2026, they'll have a full 20-seater glider in operation.
These electric seagliders don't just work over water. They can fly over ice, deserts - basically
any flat surface without obstacles.
Military? Interested. Cargo companies? Interested. Regular travelers? Very interested.
The real game-changer comes by 2029 when they plan to open intercontinental routes.
Imagine flying from Dubai to Los Angeles in one of these!
At just Rs 600 per seat for a journey that would cost thousands by plane, these seagliders
could completely transform how we think about coastal travel.
Is this the future of transportation we've been waiting for? Could these Indian-made seagliders
be the next revolution in how we travel?

3D printed house
Hook1- This 2200 square foot luxury house in Pune was literally printed.
Like a regular printer, but with concrete.
And it is changing how India builds homes.
Hook2- These 3 IIT graduates literally printed this 2200 square foot luxury house in Pune!
Yes not constructed, Printed.
Like a regular printer, but with concrete.
And it is changing how India builds homes.
Here is the wild part.
A massive 2200 square foot villa, created by a printer.
Think of a giant robotic arm, moving with millimeter precision, laying down concrete layer
by layer.
The company behind this? A 3 crore rupee startup called Tvasta, founded by three IIT
graduates.
But here is where it gets interesting.
They created a special concrete mix using industrial waste.
And the results? Mind blowing.
They finished the entire villa in just 4 months.
With zero construction waste.
And the homes use 50 percent less energy.
No one believed it was possible.
Even Godrej, one of India's biggest real estate giants, challenged them to prove it.

This house? This was their answer.
You see, traditional construction in India has a massive problem.
30 percent of materials go to waste.
Projects face endless delays.
And costs? They just keep rising.
But now, major real estate companies are lining up to work with Tvasta.
And this is exactly why I am sharing this with you today.
There is a massive business opportunity here.
Construction is a trillion dollar industry.
And it is desperate for innovation.
Think about this.
India needs millions of new homes every year.
And there is space in the market for not just one.
But one hundred such companies.
This is not just about one startup anymore.
This is about transforming how India builds.
The opportunity is wide open.
By 2026, your next home might not be built.
It might be printed. And you could be printing it.

2026 will be more competitive than ever.
Hindustan Motors is investing a massive ₹600 crore in development to ensure this
comeback isn't just about nostalgia – it's about creating India's next automotive icon.
Production will happen at the Chennai plant, with prices expected between ₹10-15 lakh
With Tesla coming in, i thought it would sweep the indian market. But i am sure
ambassador would give a tough competition

Will this blend of retro charm and cutting-edge technology reclaim the Ambassador's
throne? Or will it struggle against established giants?

Fevicol
Hook1- This man worked as a peon making ₹50/month... Today his company is worth ₹650
billion
Hook2- If you think you need a fancy degree to build a billion-dollar company, this peon's story
will shock you
You're not gonna believe this story... See, back in the 1950s, there was this guy named
Balvant Parekh.
here's where it gets interesting... Every day, he'd watch carpenters struggle with these messy
animal-based glues. They'd have to heat it up, It was super inconvenient, And Most
vegetarians wouldn't even touch it. Now, most people would just ignore this problem. But
Balvant? He saw an opportunity that EVERYONE else missed.
Instead of accepting things as they were, he teamed up with his brother and started
experimenting.
In 1959, they launched something revolutionary: Fevicol - a ready-to-use synthetic adhesive.
But wait, the genius wasn't just the product... It was what they did next. Instead of going to
fancy stores, They went straight to the carpenters. Showed them how it worked. Made them
brand ambassadors without spending a rupee. The results? MIND-BLOWING. Today, Fevicol
is so popular in India, People don't say "pass the adhesive" They say "pass the Fevicol" even

when it’s not a fevicol this is called “
Brand genericization” 
And That's how you know
you've made it!
And that peon everyone underestimated? His company now controls 70% of India's adhesive
market. Worth ₹650 billion! 🤯
But here's the real lesson. Success doesn't care about your job title. It cares about your ability
to solve problems. Balvant didn't just sell glue... He solved a problem that affected millions. So
next time you notice something annoying in your daily life...
Remember: That might be your billion-dollar opportunity waiting to happen.

Mutant mosquito
HOOK 1: This mosquito kills over 1 million people every year.
And this is a mutant mosquito made in labs that could save 1 million lives every year.
THis is not science fiction, ITS REALITY
Hook 2 : The mosquito you are looking at right now was made in labs and could save millions
of lives.
It has the ability to eradicate dangerous diseases like malaria.
Scientists are now releasing these genetically modified insects worldwide. But then I
discovered the surprising truth.
Every year, mosquitoes kill more humans than sharks, snakes, and people combined.
They're Earth's deadliest animal. And they're winning.
Plot twist. These lab-created mutants are actually our secret weapon.
Here's where it gets interesting.

Scientists engineered male mosquitoes with a self-destruct gene that gets passed to their
offspring.
And since only female mosquitoes bite and spread disease, when these modified males mate,
their female offspring can't survive to adulthood.
The results are mind-blowing.
In Brazil, mosquito populations dropped 90 percent in treated areas.
Dengue fever cases plummeted almost immediately.
Now you might have heard wild theories about secret vaccines, population control, or
government tracking.
But here's the truth.
After 10 years of research, scientists found these mosquitoes cause no harm to humans,
create no environmental damage, and dramatically reduce deadly diseases.
The technology is transforming how we fight humanity's oldest killer.
Scientists believe this approach could potentially end malaria, stop dengue fever, and save
millions of lives each year.
But wait. The company behind this is now expanding releases to cities across America, Asia,
and Africa.
Would you want these mutant mosquitoes released in your neighborhood?

Instamaid service
Hook 1- You can now get a maid for Rs 45 per hour and that too in 15 minutes by clicking
a button on the app.

Hook 2: One click on this app and you will have a maid at your house in 15 minutes for
just Rs 45 per hour
Hook 3 :This is crazy! Now you can get a maid in 15 minutes and that too for just rs 45
per hour
Thanks to Insta Maid, the new service by Urban Company.
But here's the crazy part,
There is a hidden evil genius strategy behind it which can make them thousands of
crores.
Let's break that down.
Every Indian household has the same maid problems. They never come on time. They
randomly change prices. They disappear during festivals. And finding a reliable one?
Nearly impossible.
Urban Company already solved this exact problem with plumbers and electricians.
Now they're targeting a market 10 times bigger. The maid service market.
They've actually been testing this model quietly. First with bathroom cleaning which
worked brilliantly well
Now here's their genius strategy.
This 45 rupee per hour, 15-minute service isn't about quick delivery at all. It's about letting
you experience what professional maid service feels like.
Think about it.
You try the service once because it's so cheap. You notice the maid arrives exactly on
time. They're professionally trained. They do everything properly. No shortcuts. No
excuses.
And once you experience this level of service, will you ever want to go back to your
unreliable maid?
That's when they'll introduce their monthly packages. Just like they did with every other
service.

But the market opportunity here is insane. Over 50 million Indian households. Each
spending thousands on maid services every month. All completely unorganized.
This isn't just another quick commerce play. This is about organizing India's largest
unorganized market. And that's worth thousands of crores.
Save this post if you're tired of daily maid problems. And follow for more breakdowns of
genius Indian business strategies.
Sadhguru’s app
Hook 1- This Indian app beat ChatGPT to become the fastest to hit 10 lakh downloads.
The crazy part? It's created by an Indian baba, a spiritual leader from India.
WHo is he and how did he make it happen?
let me break it down
Hook2- Sadhguru's app just beat ChatGPT to become fastest app to hit 10 lakh
downloads.
It got 10 lakh downloads in 15 hours while ChatGPT took 4 full days.
But how did he make it happen?
You see People aren't downloading a game or social platform - they're downloading
meditation, a practice thousands of years old
Hook3- This Indian baba made an app which beat ChatGPT.
His app became the fastest app to hit 10L downloads in 24 hours.
Wo is he and how did he make it happen?
let me break it down

This crazy app reached 1 million downloads in just 15 hours, while ChatGPT took 4 full
days. People aren't downloading a game or social platform - they're downloading
meditation, a practice thousands of years old.
The app launched on an Indian festival day and went global instantly by offering what the
wellness industry doesn't: simplicity and zero cost. Just 7 minutes of guided meditation
with no subscriptions, no ads, and no upsells.
The app is Miracle of Mind, created by Sadhguru of Isha Foundation. When he
announced, "Here's a tool for your mind," people worldwide responded immediately.
Within 15 hours, it trended in over 20 countries across multiple continents without
marketing campaigns or celebrity endorsements.
The contrast is striking: Headspace demands "$12.99 monthly," Calm sells "Celebrity
sleep stories," while Sadhguru simply offered "7 minutes to miracle."
His success comes from addressing the global mental health crisis, removing all barriers
with a free multilingual app, and providing AI-powered insights without complexity.
Business leaders praise it for improving productivity, while users love its intuitive design
that encourages consistent practice.
While other apps fight for our attention, Sadhguru created something that gives attention
back to the user. That's not just good marketing. That's truly a miracle of mind.
Freezing people
Hook 1 : What if you could become alive after dying?
Hook 2 : What if you could wake up 100 years after you die to see the future?
Hook 3: Would you pay 1.5 crores to come alive a few years after you die?
Well, this is possible says a A Berlin based startup
The crazy part?
650 people already paid ₹1.5+ crore each and have signed up for it.
This startup is preserving human bodies at -320°F, gambling on future technology to revive
them.

Death has always been the ultimate end... but what if it wasn't?
Six humans are already preserved in liquid nitrogen, waiting for science to catch up.
Tomorrow Bio arrives immediately after you're declared legally dead, racing against the clock
to begin preservation.
First, they replace your blood with medical-grade antifreeze.
Then they gradually cool your body over a week until you're fully preserved in liquid nitrogen.
But here's where it gets interesting... they're not just freezing humans.
Five pets have already been preserved by the same company.
The co-founder, Fernando Azevedo Pinheiro, believes that within his lifetime, we'll be able to
safely revive complex organisms.
Most scientists remain skeptical, calling it an expensive gamble.
But the cryonics industry has been quietly growing since the 1960s.
Think about it: If they're right, these people might wake up centuries from now, experiencing
space travel, advanced medicine, or technologies we can't even imagine.
Would you freeze your body for a chance at a second life? Or is this just an expensive way to
avoid accepting death?
Follow for more mind-blowing science that might just change how we think about life and
death.
Monkfruit
Hook 1- This tiny fruit here can completely replace the sugar in your kitchen and has zero
calories
Hook 2 : This Chinese secret fruit is making Indians enjoy sweets without raising blood sugar.
And doctors are amazed.

And diabetic specialists are recommending it to everyone.
Indians consume more sugar than almost any country on earth. We add it to our chai,
desserts, and even our savory dishes.
Until I discovered this Chinese superfood called monk fruit. It tastes exactly like sugar but has
absolutely zero calories and zero effect on blood sugar.
Here's the mind-blowing part. It contains natural compounds called mogrosides that are 300
times sweeter than regular sugar, but your body processes them completely differently.
Let's compare. One teaspoon of regular sugar has 16 calories and sends your insulin levels
soaring. One teaspoon of monk fruit sweetener? Zero calories and no insulin spike
whatsoever. That's why doctors call it the miracle sweetener.
I've been using monk fruit in my daily chai for three months now,2 I can't even tell the
difference. Perfect for diabetics or anyone trying to cut down on sugar.
But why am I telling you this?
Because there's a massive business opportunity here.
Only a handful of imported brands sell monk fruit sweetener in India, making it expensive and
hard to find.
Meanwhile, India has the second-highest number of diabetic patients in the world - over 101
million people actively looking for sugar alternatives.
Scientists have recently succeeded in growing monk fruit right here in Himachal Pradesh for
the first time ever.
Think about it. A zero-calorie, natural sugar alternative in a country with one of the highest
diabetes rates? And now we can grow it locally?
The global monk fruit market is projected to reach billions of dollars by 2030, with almost no
competition in India yet.

Brocode beer
Hook 1: One word on this beer bottle saved brocode crores of rupees.
BroCode sells wine disguised as pure and the reason why they do it pure evil genius….
Hook 2 : BroCode became one of India's hottest beer brands. But here's the crazy part... they
don't even sell beer.
They sell wine disguised as pure and the reason why they do it pure evil genius
Everyone orders BroCode thinking it's beer. That's exactly what they wanted.
Look closely at their bottle. Something's hidden in plain sight.
BroCode isn't beer at all. It's wine packaged as beer. With 15 percent alcohol, that's three
times stronger than regular beer.
They also make sure it is placed next to beer instead of wine so that perception stays as beer.
But wait, it gets better.
On every bottle, they wrote Kraft Sekt. That's German for Craft Wine. They never even lied
about it.
Here's the genius part. In India, beer gets taxed two times more than wine.
So by selling wine as beer, they pay half the taxes while everyone thinks they're drinking beer.
This one move by BroCode created India's favorite party drink, saved crores in taxes, and
stayed completely legal.
Sometimes the biggest business innovations are hiding in plain sight, just in a different
language.
Have you come across BroCode?

Shirataki rice
This Japanese secret food is making Indians lose weight without giving up their favorite food.
And doctors are shocked.
Look at these two plates. Both are rice. But one will make you fat, the other burns fat. Want to
know how?
Indians love rice. We eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Until I discovered this Japanese superfood. It looks and tastes like rice, but has almost zero
calories.
Here's the crazy part. It's made from a special fiber called glucomannan that expands in your
stomach, making you feel full while eating almost nothing.
Let's compare. One bowl of regular rice has 360 calories. One bowl of Shirataki? Just 10 to 20
calories. That's why nutritionists call it miracle rice.
I've started using this rice twice a week and personally love how it perfectly replaces regular
rice in all our Indian dishes.
Its called Shirataki Rice
But why am I telling you this?
Because there's a massive business opportunity here.
Only one brand sells Shirataki rice in India, making it expensive.
Meanwhile, Indians are becoming more health-conscious every day, actively looking for
healthier alternatives.
Think about it. A almost zero calorie rice alternative in a country that loves rice?
The global market is projected to reach 14.5 billion dollars by 2032. There's a huge
opportunity for anyone who can manufacture this locally and make it affordable.
