This tiny device on my head can help me decide what I want to see in my dreams everyday!
You can literally become a super human with this device.
The crazy part? You can book this today for about 8 thousand rupees.
If you're wondering how it does it, it leverages the power of lucid dreams.
But before I tell you why lucid dreams are extremely powerful, let me introduce you to Prophetic.
A neuroscience company that's changing dream technology forever.
Their device is called The Halo, and it's the world's first AI-powered dream controller.
In normal dreams, your brain's control center is completely off. That's why you can't control
when you're being chased by monsters or falling off cliffs.
But lucid dreams are different. Tesla, Einstein, and other geniuses made their biggest
breakthroughs through lucid dreams.
The only problem is that they couldn't control when these dreams happened.
The Halo changes everything.
Using precise ultrasonic waves to target your brain's dream control center, it lets you trigger
lucid dreams on demand.
Imagine testing dangerous experiments, practicing any skill, or solving impossible problems - all
while sleeping safely in your bed.
You can book Prophetic's Halo for just 8000 rupees, while the whole device costs upto one lakh
rupees.

### **9.2 Business Strategy Script Example**
```
Mukesh Ambani killed Dunzo.
He did by investing over 2000 crores in the company.
Everyone thought Ambani lost money on Dunzo.
But let me show you his evil genius masterplan with which he made 10s of thousands of crores.
Let's look at step 1 of Ambani's trap.
Find a desperate company.
Invest 2000 crores.
Get a board seat.
Access all data.
Simple. Right?
But wait. It gets better.
Here's where Ambani showed his 200 IQ moves.
First. He blocked other investors.
Then. Refused to lower valuation.
Next. Set impossible targets.
And watched them burn 100 crores every month.
While everyone thought he was losing money.
He was actually executing his master plan.
Want to know what Ambani REALLY got for 2000 crores?
Complete market research.
Best talent pool.
Customer data worth thousands of crores.
Competitor's playbook.
Tech stack insights.
And then. Came the master stroke.
While Dunzo was dying:
JioMart grew 400 percent.
They copied their best features.
Hired their top talent.
Took their market share.
Ambani wasn't failing.
He was feasting.
Need proof?
Dunzo went from 2000 to just 50 employees.
All founders resigned.
18 months of unpaid salaries.
Meanwhile. JioMart?
Became a 80,000 crore giant.
This wasn't just business.
This was Ambani's Art of War.
Remember this.
Sometimes the biggest companies don't compete.
They invest.
And eliminate.
Have you tried Dunzo? Let me know in comments and do follow me for such insightful
breakdowns.
```
### **9.3 Life Hack Script Example**
```
Every iPhone user is paying a hidden tax that aren't aware of.
Its called apple tax and it means you could be paying upto 100% more while buying the exact
same product vs android or web.
Let me show you proof.
The exact same 500 grams of grapes on Zepto costs 65 rupees on Android and 146 rupees on
iPhone.
But it's not just groceries.
On Flipkart, a Mokobara suitcase shows up at 4,119 rupees with a 65% discount on Android.
The exact same suitcase on iPhone? 4,799 rupees with only a 60% discount.
And this is happening everywhere.
Ola and Uber charging more for the same route. Travel websites showing higher prices for the
same flights. All because you're using an iPhone.
Why is this happening?
Two major reasons.
First, the Apple Tax - every time you make a purchase through an iPhone app, Apple takes 30%
while Android takes 15%. And companies pass these charges directly to you.
Second, Companies see iPhone users as premium customers.
They assume if you can afford an iPhone, you can afford to pay more. So they show you higher
prices and smaller discounts, all based on your phone choice.
The solution?
Always check prices on both Android and iPhone before purchasing.
Don't let companies charge you more just because of your phone choice.
Save this information - it might just save you from paying the Apple Tax. Follow for more
insightful breakdowns!

Samay Raina’s Latent app
Hook 1:
Samay raina is a pure marketing genius. what he just did blew my mind.
Hook 2 :
Samay Raina beat Netflix and Hotstar with just one Instagram story.
He casually dropped an app for his show "India Got Latent" and it instantly became the most
downloaded entertainment app in India. But here's what's fascinating - people are going crazy
to download an app to watch something that's already free on YouTube.
The psychology behind this? Pure genius.
His show is already crushing it with 20 million views per episode. Why? Because he does
what TV networks won't. Poonam Pandey as judge, Rakhi Sawant uncensored, guests TV
channels wouldn't dare touch - pure, raw, unfiltered content.
So when he simply posted "Hey, dropped an app for the show," people went crazy. They knew
what that meant: if the YouTube show is this spicy, imagine what's in the app's exclusive
section.
This isn't random. It's called the Velvet Rope Effect.
Within 24 hours, he hit number one on the App Store. No marketing campaigns. No
promotions. Just one story.
Look at the contrast:
Netflix begs "Please download our app"
Hotstar shouts "We have IPL!"
Samay just whispers "Want more Latent?"
Boom. Number one.
The psychological masterpiece? Three triggers:
People were already addicted to the free content
He promised exclusive access
He created FOMO without even trying
While others spend millions on marketing, he made his free show so good that people are
fighting to pay for more. All he had to say was "app's live."
Hit follow for more psychology insights nobody's talking about. Save this marketing
masterclass for later.
Milaf Cola
Hook 1 : This startup just turned fruit into drink which has become Coca-Cola's biggest
competition.
Hook 2 : Gen Z is abandoning Coca-Cola, and this ancient fruit based drink is the reason why.
For the first time in 137 years, Coca-Cola is actually scared of a competitor.
And it's not Pepsi.
Now here is the crazy part, this drink is made entirely from DATES.
Yes, the fruit. They've turned dates into a cola that people are calling 'liquid sunshine' - with
zero added sugar.
Saudi Arabia just backed this with 2.5 billion dollars, and they're selling it for just 70 cents per
can. Gen Z is already loving it - 33% are ditching sugary sodas completely.
But here's why I'm actually sharing this - this is HUGE for India. With companies like
Reliance's Campa Cola and new startups, we have a massive opportunity.
Think about it: India is becoming more health-conscious than ever. We have the
manufacturing capability, the market size, and guess what? We even have our own date
farms.
And here's the best part - with Zepto, Blinkit, and other quick commerce platforms, any new
beverage brand can reach millions of Indians in minutes.
The next big natural cola brand could come from India. For entrepreneurs watching this - the
blueprint is right here.
The market is ready. Follow for more game-changing business opportunities.
Kunal Bahl
Hook 1
Meet the shark of sharks, Kunal Bhal who turned 50 lakhs into 200 plus crores and then
invested in over 280 startups.
Here is his crazy story and why i think he is the real deal
In 2010, he started with a simple idea.
Hook : 2
This new Shark turned 50 lakhs into 200 plus crores.
Post that he invested in over 280 startups and god knows how much money he has made !
He is the Shark of all the sharks. Here is why.
But before that you need to know his crazy story
Meet Kunal Bahl.
In 2010, he started with a simple idea. A website selling daily deals and discount coupons
But then he made a bold move that changed everything. He completely transformed his
business model.
Turned his company Snapdeal into an e-commerce giant.
And guess what ? It worked. The company exploded in growth. Hit a massive 54,000 crore
valuation.
While everyone was focused on his success with Snapdeal, Kunal was quietly making
another move.
He spotted a small startup that nobody believed in. His investment? Just 50 lakhs in a
company called Ola Cabs.
Here's where it gets crazy. That one 50 lakh investment? Turned into over 200 crores. But
Kunal wasn't done. This was just the beginning.
Through his fund Titan Capital, he went on to spot unicorns before anyone else. Razorpay
before it became huge. Mamaearth before it became a household name. Urban Company
before it revolutionized services.
Today's numbers? Mind-blowing. He's backed more than 280 startups. More than any other
shark on the show. Many giving 100x returns to him
What makes him different? He's been in the founder's and investors' shoes both.
From founding Snapdeal to becoming Shark Tank India's most experienced investor. This is
why they call him the Shark of Sharks.

Mukesh Ambani’s 1l crores land
Hook 1:
This land is worth 1L crores but Ambani bought it for just 2200 crores and that too legally
Hook 2:
Ambani bought 100,000 crore rupees worth of land for just 2,200 crore rupees.
And he did it legally!
Here is the crazy story of how he made it happen.
instead of buying the land directly, Ambani made a genius move.
He bought 74 percent stake in a company called NMIIA, at just 28.50 rupees per share which
owned the land.
Now here's where it gets interesting.
This massive 5,286-acre land in Navi Mumbai sits next to a new international airport, India's
largest port, the Atal Setu, and the Mumbai-Pune Highway.
The masterstroke? Reliance had already invested 6,162 crore rupees in this project, making
them the largest creditor. So when CIDCO waived its first right of refusal, the deal was sealed.
Think about it: Land worth 100,000 crore rupees, acquired for just 2,200 crore rupees, through
perfect corporate planning. This could be Mukesh Ambani's greatest chess move yet.
The question everyone's asking: What is Reliance planning to do with land bigger than 4,000
football fields?

House in Italy
You can buy this house in Italy for just 85 rupees.
Not just this home, even this , this and 100s more ( show a ton of beautiful homes of italy )
No, this isn't clickbait.
Italian towns are literally selling beautiful houses for the price of your chai. But the reason why
they are doing it is genius.
See, hundreds of beautiful Italian villages are slowly becoming ghost towns. Young people are
leaving for big cities. And thousands of historic homes are sitting empty. These aren't just any
homes. We're talking about centuries old Italian architecture.
But here's where it gets interesting. These towns came up with a genius plan. They're selling
homes to anyone in the world. Including Indians. For just 85 rupees.
Now here's the plot twist. You'll need about 20 to 40 lakhs for renovations. And you must
finish them in 3 years. But here's what most people don't know.
These towns are actually helping buyers. You get free architectural guidance. Fast tracked
permits. Tax benefits for 5 years. And some towns even offer extra incentives for young
families.
Let me tell you about Rahul ( name changed ) from Mumbai. He bought one of these homes
last year. Spent 25 lakhs on renovations. And he earns 1.5 lakhs monthly through Airbnb.
But that's not all. You can use these homes for remote work. Hello, European time zone
clients. Or start a tourism business. Maybe plan for retirement. Or just have your dream Italian
vacation home.
What a win win strategy right?
Would you be keen to grab one? Let me know

If you're using an iPhone, you're paying up to 124% more for the exact same products.
The reason? The Hidden Apple Tax!
Let me show you proof.
The exact same 500 grams of grapes on Zepto costs 65 rupees on Android and 146 rupees
on iPhone.
But it's not just groceries.
On Flipkart, a Mokobara suitcase shows up at 4,119 rupees with a 65% discount on Android.
The exact same suitcase on iPhone? 4,799 rupees with only a 60% discount.
And this is happening everywhere.
Ola and Uber charging more for the same route. Travel websites showing higher prices for the
same flights. All because you're using an iPhone.
Why is this happening?
Two major reasons.
First, the Apple Tax - every time you make a purchase through an iPhone app, Apple takes
30% while Android takes 15%. And companies pass these charges directly to you.
Second, Companies see iPhone users as premium customers.
They assume if you can afford an iPhone, you can afford to pay more. So they show you
higher prices and smaller discounts, all based on your phone choice.
The solution?
Always check prices on both Android and iPhone before purchasing.
Don't let companies charge you more just because of your phone choice.

Puma recovery
A footballer threw these 20 thousand rupee Puma boots in the dustbin during a live match.
What Puma did next was absolute genius.
This could have been a complete disaster. Chelsea star Cucurella slipped twice wearing these
brand new Puma boots, costing his team two goals. In front of millions watching live.
He didn't just change the boots - he ran to the bench mid-game, ripped them off, and later
posted a photo of them in the trash.
Think about this: Millions of people just watched a professional footballer throw your premium
product in the dustbin. Sales could have crashed overnight.
But Puma's response? Brilliant.
Within 24 hours, they posted a "Caution: Wet Floor" sign with Cucurella's signature bushy
hair, and one perfect caption: "It's not how you slip, it's how you bounce back."
The internet exploded. Even rival players couldn't help but share it. A PR nightmare turned
into marketing gold overnight.
The story gets even better - Cucurella scored his first Premier League goal in his next match,
wearing Puma boots. You couldn't script it better.
For marketers watching this - sometimes your biggest crisis can become your biggest
opportunity. It's all about how you respond.

Tamil Nadu women empowerment
hook1- This Indian state has more working women than any other state
Hook2- This Indian state is leading women empowerement?
The crazy part? They were invited by Davos to teach the world how they're making it
happen.
Davos is the world's most exclusive economic forum where billionaires, world leaders,
and top CEOs meet to shape global policies. Even getting invited is HUGE.
Want to know which state?
Here's a hint... 43% of ALL women working in India's manufacturing sector are in this
ONE state alone. That's 6.79 lakh women.
It's TAMIL NADU.
While other states are still figuring it out, Tamil Nadu's crushing records. Their rural
areas? 35.5% women in workforce. That's 13% higher than their urban areas!
But here's what's mind-blowing... 64% of their women work in service and manufacturing,
when the national average is just 43%. And they ranked number 2 in India for
women-owned businesses!
No wonder they're launching Bullish on TN at Davos 2025, with 50 high-stakes meetings
lined up. From 7 AM to 10 PM, for 3 straight days.
When the world's biggest economic forum says "Come teach us your secrets"... you know
something special is happening.
Tamil Nadu isn't just participating in the global race... they're showing the world how it's
done.

Ikea strategy
Hook 1: If you think Ikea stores are badly located then you don’t know about the crazy
marketing tactic they have been using which ends up making you spend 40% more.
Hook 2: Ever Thought why are all the IKEA stores located on the outskirts of cities?
Their 'inconvenient' locations made them a $44 billion empire
Body:
IKEA's store locations aren't random - they're actually genius
Most companies fight for prime city locations, but IKEA does the opposite
The average IKEA store sits 45 minutes from city centers, surrounded by nothing but parking
lots and highways
This isn't a cost-cutting move - it's actually brilliant psychology. Here's how it works...
When you invest time and gas money to reach an IKEA, your brain activates something called
the 'sunk cost fallacy'
Your mind thinks: 'I've already spent so much effort getting here, I need to make this trip worth
it.' This makes you more likely to fill your cart with items you weren't planning to buy
But here's where IKEA's strategy gets even smarter...
They build massive showrooms in these locations - typically 300,000 square feet. The extra
space costs way less because land is cheaper outside cities
This means they can create entire room displays, letting you imagine the furniture in your
home, making you more likely to purchase
The result? IKEA's psychological strategy helped them build a $44 billion empire - by making
their stores harder to reach

Here's what's wild. When mammoths roamed the Earth:
Their massive feet packed down snow, preserving the permafrost
They knocked down trees, preventing forest overgrowth
They basically kept the Arctic frozen
But when they disappeared, everything changed:
The ground got soft
Forests grew unchecked
The Arctic started melting
Our climate shifted dramatically
Now Colossal has a crazy plan to bring them back:
16 labs worldwide
Cutting-edge genetic tech
Advanced AI systems

2 Cr juice shop
This juice shop makes almost 2 crore rupees working just 4 hours a day.
Sounds impossible, right?
This Pune entrepreneur cracked the code, and its genius/
Most people work over 12 hours, fighting for the same customers.
But this guy? He did something completely different.
Instead of one big fancy shop, he started tiny portable juice counters near parks and running
tracks.
Here is where it gets interesting.
He only operates from 5 AM to 9 AM, when most shops are still closed. Targeting morning
joggers when they are craving something healthy.
And it gets better.
He did not stop at one counter.
He expanded to 60 plus locations. Each making 1000 rupees daily, with just 400 rupees in
costs, and 300 rupees for staff.
That is 300 rupees profit, per counter, per day, times 60 plus locations. The math is insane.
Let me break it down. 1.96 crore yearly revenue. 60 lakh pure profit. All from working just 4
hours daily.
Here is the real business lesson.
Success is not about working longer hours. It is about finding the right timing and the right
audience.

It's insane.
This is Mark, a former NASA engineer turned youtuber who's launching a satellite called
SATGUS that takes photos of you from space with Earth photobombing in the background.
Now in order to make the satellite functional, he had to solve a bunch of major challenges.
One is power - he designed special solar panels that can fully charge a phone 9 times in just
a 90-minute orbit.
But here's where it gets really crazy - he invented this reaction wheel system with three
spinning flywheels that lets the satellite rotate precisely in any direction without thrusters.
It's pretty nuts, but the craziest part of all is that he's been documenting the whole journey.
After 3 years of development, the satellite's about to launch into orbit in just a couple months.

Hook1- Google, Microsoft, and Apple are leaving Bangalore. Their new destination? A city
that was barely on the tech map 10 years ago.
Hook2- Bangalore is losing its crown as India's Silicon Valley. And it's happening faster than
anyone predicted."
For 40 years, Bangalore was untouchable in India's tech scene. The undisputed king of
startups."
But in 2024, something changed. Startup funding dropped 19%. Traffic became unbearable.
Office rent? Through the roof."
Meanwhile, 650 km away, another city was silently building something massive. Not just
another tech hub. But a complete ecosystem."
Enter Hyderabad. T-Hub 2.0: A ₹1000 crore mega-project. World-class offices at half
Bangalore's prices. And here's the genius part..."
While Bangalore struggled with infrastructure, Hyderabad built wider roads, better metros, and
faster permits. The result?"
"Google, Microsoft, Uber - all moving their biggest R&D centers here. Startup funding? Up
156%. But here's what everyone missed..."
"It wasn't just about buildings or funding. Hyderabad's success comes down to one thing:
They didn't try to be the next Bangalore."
They created their own playbook. Focused on solving problems, not copying success. And
that's the billion-dollar lesson."

Hybrid animals
Hook 1: Japan is creating these creatures in real
They are half human and half animal created in a lab.
The reason why japan is doing it would blow your mind.
Hook 2: This is crazy! ( Show images and bring them to life using AI to create a crazy hook )
What are you looking at right now are hybrids. They are part human and part animal.
And Japan just made it legal to create new creatures
The reason would blow your mind.
Let me explain
Scientists are combining human cells with animal embryos, creating something that's never
existed before in human history.
The ethics? Highly controversial. The potential? Absolutely mind-blowing.
You see Every single day, 17 people die waiting for organ transplants.
Over 100,000 people sit on waiting lists, watching their time run out. Countless families lose
hope, knowing help might not come in time.
But these hybrids could change everything. Here's exactly how it works.
First, scientists take an animal embryo. Then, they remove specific genes that control organ
development. Next, they insert human stem cells. Finally, they let it develop under strict
supervision.
The result? An animal that can grow human organs inside it. Perfect matches. Zero rejection
risk. No more endless waiting lists.
The world is completely divided on this. Some people call it unethical. Others say we're
playing God. Many fear what could happen if this goes wrong.
But Japan's rules are incredibly strict. No human brain development is allowed. No
reproductive experiments. The pure focus is on saving human lives.
Think about what this means. A child could get a new heart in weeks, not years. A mother
could receive a kidney without waiting for tragedy to strike. A father could survive because we
didn't give up.
The future isn't coming anymore. It's already here. And it's more sci-fi than anything we could
have imagined.
If this blows your mind like it did mine, hit follow for more groundbreaking science that's

Pickleball
Hook1- Rich Indians are ditching cricket for a children's backyard game
You won't believe
In Mumbai, people are spending ₹15,000 per hour
Just to play this American kid's game from 1965.
And it's growing 400% faster than cricket in India.
Started with a bored family using broken equipment?
Hook2- The rich in Mumbai aren't playing golf anymore. They've switched to a sport that
started in someone's backyard. And it's making them richer.
This is how a backyard game became the status symbol of Rich India.
Body- In 1965, three dads in America couldn't find their badminton equipment. So they
improvised with ping pong paddles and a plastic ball. They called it Pickleball.
But here's the crazy part: India had ZERO courts for this sport until 2023.
Plot twist: Today, there are 1000+ courts. 70,000+ players. And 40-50 new courts are being
built every month.
But why is everyone obsessed?
Because unlike cricket or football, Pickleball lets you become a pro in months, not years. It's
easier on your body than tennis. And takes less time than golf.
The elite caught on quickly: Last year's championship had a 1 crore prize pool. Private clubs
are adding courts faster than ever. And CEOs are closing deals over Pickleball matches.
Here's what most people miss: This isn't just about sports. It's proof that sometimes the
biggest opportunities... Come from the most unexpected places.
Think about it: A game invented by bored dads... It is now India's fastest-growing luxury sport.
So next time someone tells you something is "just a silly trend" Remember: Every billion-dollar
industry started as someone's "crazy idea."

500 km per hour! It also aims to offer ZERO carbon travel.By offering zero-carbon travel
options, these innovative vehicles not only reduce environmental impact but also provide a
compelling alternative to traditional modes of transport.
The craziest part?
Anand Mahindra himself is hyping them up, calling the design "stunning" and praising IIT
Madras for rivaling Silicon Valley in nurturing this startup.
You're probably thinking this is just another fancy concept that'll never happen, right? Wrong!
They already have a working prototype and by April 2025, a 100 kg version will be ready. By
2026, they'll have a full 20-seater glider in operation.
These electric seagliders don't just work over water. They can fly over ice, deserts - basically
any flat surface without obstacles.
Military? Interested. Cargo companies? Interested. Regular travelers? Very interested.
The real game-changer comes by 2029 when they plan to open intercontinental routes.
Imagine flying from Dubai to Los Angeles in one of these!
At just Rs 600 per seat for a journey that would cost thousands by plane, these seagliders
could completely transform how we think about coastal travel.

The company behind this? A 3 crore rupee startup called Tvasta, founded by three IIT
graduates.
But here is where it gets interesting.
They created a special concrete mix using industrial waste.
And the results? Mind blowing.
They finished the entire villa in just 4 months.
With zero construction waste.
And the homes use 50 percent less energy.
No one believed it was possible.
Even Godrej, one of India's biggest real estate giants, challenged them to prove it.
This house? This was their answer.
You see, traditional construction in India has a massive problem.
30 percent of materials go to waste.
Projects face endless delays.
And costs? They just keep rising.
But now, major real estate companies are lining up to work with Tvasta.
And this is exactly why I am sharing this with you today.
There is a massive business opportunity here.
Construction is a trillion dollar industry.
And it is desperate for innovation.
Think about this.
India needs millions of new homes every year.
And there is space in the market for not just one.
But one hundred such companies.
This is not just about one startup anymore.
This is about transforming how India builds.
The opportunity is wide open.
By 2026, your next home might not be built.
It might be printed. And you could be printing it.

Hook2- What you are looking at right now is a REAL city which runs on Artificial
Intelligence
It is the most futuristic city in the world
The crazy part.
Real humans are going to move into this city next year.
At the base of Mount Fuji, Toyota is building something revolutionary.
They call it Woven City.
And it is unlike anything we have ever seen before.
Imagine a city that works like a giant computer.
Where everything is connected through one massive AI system.
Your home actively monitors your health.
The streets can reshape themselves.
And robots learn from each other in real time.
Let me show you the most fascinating part.
The entire city is woven together like fabric.
With three different types of streets.
One for self driving vehicles.
One for smaller mobility devices.
And one just for people.
But here is what makes it truly revolutionary.
The vehicles in this city can transform.
One moment they are delivery trucks.
The next they become mobile offices.
All orchestrated by AI like a giant game of chess.
Now here is why this matters.
Toyota is not just building another smart city.
They are creating a living laboratory.
360 people will become the first humans to live in an AI powered city.
Every movement they make.
Every action they take.
Helps train the AI to build better cities.
This is not science fiction.
Construction is already underway.
And the first residents move in 2025.
Think about that for a moment.
A city that knows what you need.
Before you even need it.
This is not the future.
This is happening right now.
Would you live in a city controlled by AI.

Fevicol
Hook1- This man worked as a peon making ₹50/month... Today his company is worth ₹650
billion
Hook2- If you think you need a fancy degree to build a billion-dollar company, this peon's story
will shock you
You're not gonna believe this story... See, back in the 1950s, there was this guy named
Balvant Parekh.
here's where it gets interesting... Every day, he'd watch carpenters struggle with these messy
animal-based glues. They'd have to heat it up, It was super inconvenient, And Most
vegetarians wouldn't even touch it. Now, most people would just ignore this problem. But
Balvant? He saw an opportunity that EVERYONE else missed.
Instead of accepting things as they were, he teamed up with his brother and started
experimenting.
In 1959, they launched something revolutionary: Fevicol - a ready-to-use synthetic adhesive.
But wait, the genius wasn't just the product... It was what they did next. Instead of going to
fancy stores, They went straight to the carpenters. Showed them how it worked. Made them
brand ambassadors without spending a rupee. The results? MIND-BLOWING. Today, Fevicol
is so popular in India, People don't say "pass the adhesive" They say "pass the Fevicol" even
when it’s not a fevicol this is called “
Brand genericization”
And That's how you know
you've made it!
And that peon everyone underestimated? His company now controls 70% of India's adhesive
market. Worth ₹650 billion! 🤯
But here's the real lesson. Success doesn't care about your job title. It cares about your ability
to solve problems. Balvant didn't just sell glue... He solved a problem that affected millions. So
next time you notice something annoying in your daily life...
Remember: That might be your billion-dollar opportunity waiting to happen.

Mutant mosquito
HOOK 1: This mosquito kills over 1 million people every year.
And this is a mutant mosquito made in labs that could save 1 million lives every year.
THis is not science fiction, ITS REALITY
Hook 2 : The mosquito you are looking at right now was made in labs and could save millions
of lives.
It has the ability to eradicate dangerous diseases like malaria.
Scientists are now releasing these genetically modified insects worldwide. But then I
discovered the surprising truth.
Every year, mosquitoes kill more humans than sharks, snakes, and people combined.
They're Earth's deadliest animal. And they're winning.
Plot twist. These lab-created mutants are actually our secret weapon.
Here's where it gets interesting.
Scientists engineered male mosquitoes with a self-destruct gene that gets passed to their
offspring.
And since only female mosquitoes bite and spread disease, when these modified males mate,
their female offspring can't survive to adulthood.
The results are mind-blowing.
In Brazil, mosquito populations dropped 90 percent in treated areas.
Dengue fever cases plummeted almost immediately.
Now you might have heard wild theories about secret vaccines, population control, or
government tracking.
But here's the truth.
After 10 years of research, scientists found these mosquitoes cause no harm to humans,
create no environmental damage, and dramatically reduce deadly diseases.
The technology is transforming how we fight humanity's oldest killer.
Scientists believe this approach could potentially end malaria, stop dengue fever, and save
millions of lives each year.
But wait. The company behind this is now expanding releases to cities across America, Asia,
and Africa.
Would you want these mutant mosquitoes released in your neighborhood?

Instamaid service
Hook 1- You can now get a maid for Rs 45 per hour and that too in 15 minutes by clicking
a button on the app.
Hook 2: One click on this app and you will have a maid at your house in 15 minutes for
just Rs 45 per hour
Hook 3 :This is crazy! Now you can get a maid in 15 minutes and that too for just rs 45
per hour
Thanks to Insta Maid, the new service by Urban Company.
But here's the crazy part,
There is a hidden evil genius strategy behind it which can make them thousands of
crores.
Let's break that down.
Every Indian household has the same maid problems. They never come on time. They
randomly change prices. They disappear during festivals. And finding a reliable one?
Nearly impossible.
Urban Company already solved this exact problem with plumbers and electricians.
Now they're targeting a market 10 times bigger. The maid service market.
They've actually been testing this model quietly. First with bathroom cleaning which
worked brilliantly well
Now here's their genius strategy.
This 45 rupee per hour, 15-minute service isn't about quick delivery at all. It's about letting
you experience what professional maid service feels like.
Think about it.
You try the service once because it's so cheap. You notice the maid arrives exactly on
time. They're professionally trained. They do everything properly. No shortcuts. No
excuses.
And once you experience this level of service, will you ever want to go back to your
unreliable maid?
That's when they'll introduce their monthly packages. Just like they did with every other
service.
But the market opportunity here is insane. Over 50 million Indian households. Each
spending thousands on maid services every month. All completely unorganized.
This isn't just another quick commerce play. This is about organizing India's largest
unorganized market. And that's worth thousands of crores.
Save this post if you're tired of daily maid problems. And follow for more breakdowns of
genius Indian business strategies.
Sadhguru’s app
Hook 1- This Indian app beat ChatGPT to become the fastest to hit 10 lakh downloads.
The crazy part? It's created by an Indian baba, a spiritual leader from India.
WHo is he and how did he make it happen?
let me break it down
Hook2- Sadhguru's app just beat ChatGPT to become fastest app to hit 10 lakh
downloads.
It got 10 lakh downloads in 15 hours while ChatGPT took 4 full days.
But how did he make it happen?
You see People aren't downloading a game or social platform - they're downloading
meditation, a practice thousands of years old
Hook3- This Indian baba made an app which beat ChatGPT.
His app became the fastest app to hit 10L downloads in 24 hours.
Wo is he and how did he make it happen?
let me break it down
This crazy app reached 1 million downloads in just 15 hours, while ChatGPT took 4 full
days. People aren't downloading a game or social platform - they're downloading
meditation, a practice thousands of years old.
The app launched on an Indian festival day and went global instantly by offering what the
wellness industry doesn't: simplicity and zero cost. Just 7 minutes of guided meditation
with no subscriptions, no ads, and no upsells.
The app is Miracle of Mind, created by Sadhguru of Isha Foundation. When he
announced, "Here's a tool for your mind," people worldwide responded immediately.
Within 15 hours, it trended in over 20 countries across multiple continents without
marketing campaigns or celebrity endorsements.
The contrast is striking: Headspace demands "$12.99 monthly," Calm sells "Celebrity
sleep stories," while Sadhguru simply offered "7 minutes to miracle."
His success comes from addressing the global mental health crisis, removing all barriers
with a free multilingual app, and providing AI-powered insights without complexity.
Business leaders praise it for improving productivity, while users love its intuitive design
that encourages consistent practice.
While other apps fight for our attention, Sadhguru created something that gives attention
back to the user. That's not just good marketing. That's truly a miracle of mind.
Freezing people
Hook 1 : What if you could become alive after dying?
Hook 2 : What if you could wake up 100 years after you die to see the future?
Hook 3: Would you pay 1.5 crores to come alive a few years after you die?
Well, this is possible says a A Berlin based startup
The crazy part?
650 people already paid ₹1.5+ crore each and have signed up for it.
This startup is preserving human bodies at -320°F, gambling on future technology to revive
them.
Death has always been the ultimate end... but what if it wasn't?
Six humans are already preserved in liquid nitrogen, waiting for science to catch up.
Tomorrow Bio arrives immediately after you're declared legally dead, racing against the clock
to begin preservation.
First, they replace your blood with medical-grade antifreeze.
Then they gradually cool your body over a week until you're fully preserved in liquid nitrogen.
But here's where it gets interesting... they're not just freezing humans.
Five pets have already been preserved by the same company.
The co-founder, Fernando Azevedo Pinheiro, believes that within his lifetime, we'll be able to
safely revive complex organisms.
Most scientists remain skeptical, calling it an expensive gamble.
But the cryonics industry has been quietly growing since the 1960s.
Think about it: If they're right, these people might wake up centuries from now, experiencing
space travel, advanced medicine, or technologies we can't even imagine.
Would you freeze your body for a chance at a second life? Or is this just an expensive way to
avoid accepting death?
Follow for more mind-blowing science that might just change how we think about life and
death.
Monkfruit
Hook 1- This tiny fruit here can completely replace the sugar in your kitchen and has zero
calories
Hook 2 : This Chinese secret fruit is making Indians enjoy sweets without raising blood sugar.
And doctors are amazed.
And diabetic specialists are recommending it to everyone.
Indians consume more sugar than almost any country on earth. We add it to our chai,
desserts, and even our savory dishes.
Until I discovered this Chinese superfood called monk fruit. It tastes exactly like sugar but has
absolutely zero calories and zero effect on blood sugar.
Here's the mind-blowing part. It contains natural compounds called mogrosides that are 300
times sweeter than regular sugar, but your body processes them completely differently.
Let's compare. One teaspoon of regular sugar has 16 calories and sends your insulin levels
soaring. One teaspoon of monk fruit sweetener? Zero calories and no insulin spike
whatsoever. That's why doctors call it the miracle sweetener.
I've been using monk fruit in my daily chai for three months now,2 I can't even tell the
difference. Perfect for diabetics or anyone trying to cut down on sugar.
But why am I telling you this?
Because there's a massive business opportunity here.
Only a handful of imported brands sell monk fruit sweetener in India, making it expensive and
hard to find.
Meanwhile, India has the second-highest number of diabetic patients in the world - over 101
million people actively looking for sugar alternatives.
Scientists have recently succeeded in growing monk fruit right here in Himachal Pradesh for
the first time ever.
Think about it. A zero-calorie, natural sugar alternative in a country with one of the highest
diabetes rates? And now we can grow it locally?
The global monk fruit market is projected to reach billions of dollars by 2030, with almost no
competition in India yet.

Brocode beer
Hook 1: One word on this beer bottle saved brocode crores of rupees.
BroCode sells wine disguised as pure and the reason why they do it pure evil genius….
Hook 2 : BroCode became one of India's hottest beer brands. But here's the crazy part... they
don't even sell beer.
They sell wine disguised as pure and the reason why they do it pure evil genius
Everyone orders BroCode thinking it's beer. That's exactly what they wanted.
Look closely at their bottle. Something's hidden in plain sight.
BroCode isn't beer at all. It's wine packaged as beer. With 15 percent alcohol, that's three
times stronger than regular beer.
They also make sure it is placed next to beer instead of wine so that perception stays as beer.
But wait, it gets better.
On every bottle, they wrote Kraft Sekt. That's German for Craft Wine. They never even lied
about it.
Here's the genius part. In India, beer gets taxed two times more than wine.
So by selling wine as beer, they pay half the taxes while everyone thinks they're drinking beer.
This one move by BroCode created India's favorite party drink, saved crores in taxes, and
stayed completely legal.
Sometimes the biggest business innovations are hiding in plain sight, just in a different
language.
Have you come across BroCode?

Shirataki rice
This Japanese secret food is making Indians lose weight without giving up their favorite food.
And doctors are shocked.
Look at these two plates. Both are rice. But one will make you fat, the other burns fat. Want to
know how?
Indians love rice. We eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Until I discovered this Japanese superfood. It looks and tastes like rice, but has almost zero
calories.
Here's the crazy part. It's made from a special fiber called glucomannan that expands in your
stomach, making you feel full while eating almost nothing.
Let's compare. One bowl of regular rice has 360 calories. One bowl of Shirataki? Just 10 to 20
calories. That's why nutritionists call it miracle rice.
I've started using this rice twice a week and personally love how it perfectly replaces regular
rice in all our Indian dishes.
Its called Shirataki Rice
But why am I telling you this?
Because there's a massive business opportunity here.
Only one brand sells Shirataki rice in India, making it expensive.
Meanwhile, Indians are becoming more health-conscious every day, actively looking for
healthier alternatives.
Think about it. A almost zero calorie rice alternative in a country that loves rice?
The global market is projected to reach 14.5 billion dollars by 2032. There's a huge
opportunity for anyone who can manufacture this locally and make it affordable.

This company is worth two hundred forty thousand crores
But here's the crazy part - they only have thirty employees
Last year they made eight thousand crores .
They have No HR department,
No fancy office,
And just ONE product manager.
And I am very sure you have installed their app on your phone.
This crazy startup for eleven years straight lost money.
Everyone said they would fail.
But in 2024... everything changed.
They reached:
Nine hundred and fifty million users
Twelve million paying subscribers
If you still haven’t guessed. I am talking about
: Telegram.
And here are 4 reasons why they are killing it :
Number one: Premium subscribers pay just four hundred rupees per month for exclusive
features. And they got twelve million of them!
Number two: Channel owners get fifty percent of all ad revenue. WhatsApp? They give zero.
Number three: They built a complete creator economy. Paid channels. Premium stickers.
Even voice call monetization.
And number four: They made smart moves in crypto, earning crores

Blinkit ambulances
Hook1- "Blinkit just launched 10-minute ambulances. The worst business model ever... yet
pure genius. Let me explain why this will lose money... but make Deepinder Goyal millions if
not billions.
Hook2- The evil genius strategy behind Deepinder Goyal launching 10 minute ambulances on
Blinkit will shock you
It will make him millions if not billions.
Here's why it's a guaranteed money-loser:
Unlike food delivery, you can't predict emergencies.
Can't optimize fleet locations.
And you need expensive medical staff 24/7.
Pure business nightmare. But it gets worse:
Private ambulances are scarce.
Emergency patterns are totally random.
And one delay could mean life or death.
No room for error.
But here's where it gets interesting.
Deepinder isn't doing this for direct profit.
He's playing 4D chess while everyone's playing checkers.
Think about it: Which brand would you trust more?
One that delivers your pizza? Or one that saves lives?
With just 5 ambulances in one city, the losses will be minimal.
But the brand trust? That's worth billions. Sometimes the worst business model can be the
smartest business move.
This is a genius-level strategy. Would you trust Blinkit with emergencies? Drop your thoughts
in the comments and Follow for more business breakdowns like this."
Samsung folded bus
Samsung folded a 6-meter London bus in half. The internet lost its mind.
This wasn't photoshop or CGI. An actual red London bus appeared overnight, bent at a
perfect 90-degree angle, towering six meters into the sky.
But here's what's crazy - this was just the beginning. Samsung didn't just fold a bus, they
folded an entire city.
They transformed Old Street Station into "Fold Street." Phone booths bent in half. Benches
twisted up. Even lampposts were folded like paper.
The scale? Mind-blowing. It took two months to build just the bus sculpture, using parts from
real recycled London buses.
But here's why I'm sharing this - this is what happens when marketing breaks free from
screens and billboards. Instead of telling people about a foldable phone, Samsung folded their
world.
Think about it: No boring product demos. No celebrity endorsements. They turned their
product's unique feature into an entire experience that people couldn't help but share.
For marketers watching this - sometimes the best way to showcase innovation isn't to explain
it, but to make people experience it in the most unexpected way possible.
Follow for more groundbreaking marketing campaigns that prove when you think big enough,
the world becomes your ad.
Sam altman’s latest blog
Hook 1 :
I couldn't sleep after reading Sam Altman's latest blog. What he revealed about 2025 if it
happens will change our lives in a scary way.
Let me give you a summary in the next 30 seconds.
Hook 2 :
Sam Altman just dropped this blog and I can't believe 99% of people haven't read it yet.
I was terrified when I read it. And after I show you why... You will be too.
Let me give you a summary in the next 30 seconds.
Just 2 years ago, ChatGPT changed everything. 100 million users became 300 million. But
that was just the beginning...
OpenAI just confirmed something huge. They're not just improving ChatGPT. They're building
something that will change every single job.
In 2025, just next year, AI agents will join the workforce. Not assist... JOIN. They'll work
alongside humans and transform company outputs.
But here's where it gets crazy. OpenAI just admitted: They know how to build AGI. Artificial
General Intelligence. The thing everyone said was impossible.
And that's not even their final goal. They're already working on something bigger:
Superintelligence. AI that can accelerate scientific discovery, transform innovation, and create
massive abundance.
Sam Altman knows this sounds crazy. He literally wrote: "This sounds like science fiction right
now and somewhat crazy to even talk about." But they're ALREADY building it.
Think about this: While most people are still learning ChatGPT basics, OpenAI is preparing to
release AI Coworkers in 2025, AGI that they know how to build, and Superintelligence that's
already in progress.
This isn't years away anymore. It's happening NOW. And 99% of people have no idea their
jobs are about to transform completely.
Drop a shocked emoji if this terrifies you too. Save this, you'll want to remember this moment.

Titktok back in india
Elon musk could be the owner of TikTok US in 5 days from now
Elon Musk is planning to buy TikTok in the US.
The crazy part? this could happen in the next 5 days.
This could change the game of social media forever and could mean a comeback of
TikTok in India.
But why is TikTok being sold? Let me explain
It all started when the US government gave TikTok an ultimatum:
Either sell to an American company.
Or get banned completely by January 19th, 2025.
So many billionaires, including Elon Musk, are in talks to buy the company.
But why is everyone fighting over TikTok?
Because if someone like Musk buys TikTok, it becomes an American company.
Which means no more China concerns.
No more data privacy issues.
And most importantly.
A potential return to India's massive market of 700 million internet users.
Think about this. If Elon actually ends up buying TikTok
For the first time ever, one person would control X with 500 million users.
TikTok US with 170 million users.
And potentially reach India's market of 700 million users.
While Zuck owns Facebook and Instagram, Elon would own Twitter and TikTok.
Making Elon Musk the biggest threat to Mark Zuckerberg's Meta empire.
But it's not going to be easy for Elon.
TikTok US could cost 50 billion dollars.
We're 5 days away from potentially the biggest shift in social media history.
From Chinese-owned to American-owned.
From banned to welcomed back.
Would you use TikTok if Elon brings it back?
Let me know in the comments and follow me for more such insightful breakdowns.The
crazy part? He might pay 50 billion dollars for it.
Whats more exciting is that this could mean a comeback of TikTok in India.
But why is TikTok being sold? Let me explain
Nvidia digits
Hook1 :
NVIDIA just launched a supercomputer that will soon be as common in our homes as WiFi
routers. And it's about to make your life completely AI-powered.
Its called Project Digits
Let me tell you how this is going to change our future
Hook 2 :
NVIDIA just launched Project DIGITS. A 100,000 dollar supercomputer that fits in your palm
for just 3,000 dollars.
Before you scroll. This isn't about tech. While everyone's talking about specs, I saw
something massive which matters to you and me.
Hook 3: 60 core rupees is the average network of each employee in this company, but that's
not even the craziest part.
The company launched a futuristic device that could turn that 60 crawls into 180 crows for all
the employees. Curious to know what this device is. Think about your home right now. You
probably have a computer.
Definitely have a smartphone. Soon you'll have this tool. It's called digits, and it's a
supercomputer that fits in your hand. Here is why it's insane and how this device will make all
of us hundred X powerful using ai. This is day two of future tech updates. Think about all the
data in your life. Every text you send, every call you make, every face-to-face conversation.
Now, add your complete health records, your Netflix binges, your Uber rides, your shopping
habits, everything about your life. AI could help with all of this. Make your life incredibly easier.
But would you trust any company with this much personal information? That's why Project
Digits changes everything.
And of course, it is made by Nvidia. It processes all this data right in your home without
internet, without cloud complete privacy like a personal AI brain. Imagine AI that knows when
you are stressed from your watch data. Remember. Every conversation from your meetings,
but keeps it all private. Yes, it's $3,000 today.
That's the price of an iPhone for a hundred thousand dollars supercomputer. That will soon be
as common as Alexa at one 10, the price, but completely private. We're witnessing the future
of personal ai. This isn't just another device. It's your future personal AI brain that keeps your
secrets private. Do follow me for more such insightful updates?
Jagdeep singh
HOOK 1: This CEO from Haryana India makes forty-eight crore rupees salary per day.
That's more than Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella earn in a month, combined.
Good chance you've never heard his name.
But in next 30 seconds, you'll understand why he's worth every rupee.
HOOK 2: He makes 48 crore rupees every single day - more than Satya Nadella and
Sundar Pichai combined. But 30 years ago, he couldn't afford a car. In 90 seconds, you'll
learn how an unknown engineer from Haryana spotted a trillion-dollar flaw that Tesla,
Toyota, and Ford all missed...
Three decades ago, he was just another engineer. No special connections. No wealthy family.
But he saw what billion-dollar companies missed.
He saw an opportunity
The electric vehicle industry had a massive problem. Not design. Not features. But batteries.
They were slow to charge, dangerous, and cost a fortune. Whoever solved this owned a
trillion-dollar future.
At thirty-nine, he risked everything. Walked away from success.
Bet his entire career on one breakthrough. A battery that changed everything: fifteen-minute
charging, double the range, zero fire risk, half the cost.
The technology was so revolutionary that Volkswagen invested three hundred million. Bill
Gates backed it. Wall Street couldn't ignore it.
Meet Jagdeep Singh, founder of QuantumScape. His historic compensation isn't guaranteed -
ninety-eight percent is stock options. If he fails, he gets nothing. If he succeeds, he transforms
transportation forever.
Now worth seven billion dollars, his company works with the world's largest automakers. But
just when everyone thought they knew his endgame, he stepped down as CEO. His next
project? Even bigger, still secret.
From an engineer in Haryana to the world's highest-paid CEO, his story proves something
powerful: solve a trillion-dollar problem, earn trillion-dollar rewards.
What impossible problem would you solve?

Hyperpure
Hook 1 :
I just discovered Zomato's secret business which generates 30% of its revenue profitablyl,
and it's pure genius
Obviously it's not food delivery
Hook 2 :
This is Zomato’s most profitable business. It generates 30 percent of the revenue but the
crazy part,
99% of people have never heard of it.
Obviously it's not food delivery.
Hook 3 :
This secret business of Zomato drives 30 percent of its revenue.
I would call you a genius if you have heard of it before.
Obviously it's not food delivery.
And no, it's not a restaurant discovery either.
And no, I am not even talking about Blinkit or District
This secret business of Zomato brought in 1671 crore rupees just this quarter, growing 95
percent year over year.
Still can guess?
I am talking about Hyperpure.
But here is where it gets interesting.
Instead of delivering food to customers, they are delivering ingredients to restaurants.
Every morning, thousands of restaurants in India struggle with one problem. Finding fresh
ingredients at decent prices.
That is when Zomato spotted a golden opportunity.
They built Hyperpure, a platform that connects farmers directly to restaurants.
No middlemen.
Better prices.
Fresh ingredients.
And here is the genius part.
They already had thousands of restaurant partners on Zomato.
Zero marketing needed.
While everyone was busy watching the food delivery war, Zomato quietly built their
biggest growth engine.

Dream 11
This Indian app makes 6000+ crores in revenue but the crazy part?
It's banned from Play Store and App Store.
Getting banned from app stores would kill most app companies. But for this company, it
became their biggest blessing.
Let me show you how being banned actually helped them win.
When you're on app stores, you have to pay apple and google 30% of your revenue. But
when you're banned, you keep all of it.
This means more cash for marketing, higher prize money for users, and better profit margins.
But it gets even better.
Because they were banned, they had no dependency on Apple or Google's rules. They got
direct access to user data and complete control over their platform.
The results were mind-blowing.
They took all the money they saved and invested it in becoming IPL's title sponsor for 222
crore. They partnered with every major cricket league. They built India's biggest gaming
community.
Still cant guess the name of the app?
I am talking about Dream11
They turned their biggest setback into their biggest advantage. Growing from just 1 million
users in 2014 to 200 million users today.

Birkenstock
Hook 1 :
These sandals cost 10,000 rupees today.
Even Steve Jobs swore by them. And his old pair just sold for 1.8 crores at auction.
Let me tell you the story behind the world's most expensive basic sandals...
Hook 2 :
These pair of old sandals just sold for 1.8 crore rupees.
You might think these don't even look like luxury designer shoes or rare sneakers. So why did
someone pay 1.8 crores for them?
Because these sandals were worn by Steve Jobs.
Body
Now here's what's interesting - you can buy a brand new pair of these same sandals today for
about 10 thousand rupees.
But why would anyone pay that much for such basic-looking sandals?
Let me tell you the story behind the world's most expensive basic sandals...
It started in 1774, when foot problems were considered normal and everyone lived with the
pain, Johann Adam Birkenstock believed shoes should be designed for both health and
comfort.
His idea was so revolutionary that German doctors started prescribing his shoes.
Then in 1896, master cobbler Konrad Birkenstock invented the 'footbed' - a special design that
molds to your unique foot shape.
Each pair goes through 17 careful steps and uses 4 special layers that mass-produced shoes
can't replicate.
While other brands chased fashion trends, Birkenstock focused on comfort. Today, that
simple idea became a 72,000 crore company.
The craziest part? Birkenstock went public in 2023, they raised 12,300 crore rupees in a single
day.
From treating foot pain in 1774, to becoming a global luxury brand worn by tech billionaires -
this is how a family of German cobblers built an empire by focusing on one simple thing:
Making comfortable shoes.
So next time you see someone wearing Birkenstocks, remember - sometimes the simplest
ideas create the biggest impact.

Here's the wild story.
Hook 2 :
This man started a flower shop that was shut down by the Delhi government.
But that one setback led him to build a 4000 crore empire.
The crazy part?
He did all of this because he couldn't find fresh flowers for his girlfriend.
Body:
Here's the wild story.
By the way, there's a good chance you've used their service already.
Meet Vikas Gutgutia. A young man in love, living in Delhi, trying to surprise his girlfriend with
fresh, beautiful flowers.
But there was a problem. Every shop sold day-old, wilted flowers.
So he took a risk. Borrowed money from friends and opened a small flower shop.
Then disaster struck. Delhi officials sealed his entire shop due to No proper license.
Everything was gone.
But that's when he had a genius idea.
Looking at his supplier list, he realized: Why sell flowers in a shop, when luxury hotels need
fresh flowers every day?
With nothing left to lose, he called the Taj Palace Hotel. Pitched his fresh flower supply
service.
And guess what? They loved the idea and became his first big client.
Today, that one sealed shop became 400 outlets across 133 cities, generating 4000 crore
revenue.
Still cant guess the name of the brand?
I am talking about Ferns N Petals. Yes, that FNP you order from.
But here's the genius move that changed everything.
He brought flower delivery online, before most Indians had internet access.
A stat that blew my mind was that 92 percent of their empire still runs on just flowers, cakes,
and gifts.
From trying to impress a girl to building India's biggest gifting brand. Sometimes setbacks
lead to comebacks.

Something like this happened with my father already.
It involves scammers cloning your voice, video and pictures using AI.
Here's something shocking - the video you're watching right now, my face, my voice - it's all
AI-generated.
If AI can create this convincing video you're watching, imagine what scammers could do with
just a few seconds of your real voice and photos.
Picture this:
It's 2 AM. Your parents get a WhatsApp video showing you injured, tied up in a dark room.
Your voice, perfectly cloned by AI, begging for help.
A scammer demands lakhs for your release.
Your parents call you, but your phone's on silent.
In that moment of panic, most parents would transfer the money instantly.
This is going to happen to everyone very soon!
But I'll show you how to protect your family before this starts happening.
Here's your action plan:
First, create a family codeword - a secret word only you and your parents know. Any money
request without this word is fake.
Second, set three emergency contacts who can verify your safety if parents can't reach you.
Third, establish the 60-minute rule - no matter how urgent, they must wait 60 minutes and
contact you and your emergency contacts before taking action
Don't wait. Sit with your parents and loved ones and educate them. Its no more a good to
have, its a necessity.

Japan’s tourism offer
Japan Airlines is giving away free flights and the reason is absolute genius.
Let me break down their genius plan and how can you can get free flights.
See, Japan has a huge tourism problem. Everyone visits the same 2 to 3 cities - Tokyo,
Kyoto, Osaka, creating massive overcrowding while beautiful regions stay empty.
So Japan Airlines did something brilliant. Instead of fighting this problem, they turned it into a
gold mine by giving free flights to 64 different airports across 133 routes in Japan.
And this is why it's genius. Empty seats get filled. Tourism spreads across Japan. People stay
longer and spend more. Small towns get tourism boost. And main cities reduce overcrowding.
Here's exactly what you need to do. First, book international round trip with Japan Airlines.
second, add domestic flights in the same booking. third, explore any part of Japan for free.
It's working so well, other airlines might copy this strategy, creating a whole new way of
traveling that benefits everyone.
This is how you solve a problem. By thinking completely differently. And sometimes, giving
away something for free is the most profitable move you can make.
Save this to plan your next Japan trip and share it with someone who plans to travel to japan

It beat Tesla to become the number 1 electric car maker in the world
Hook 2 :
You won't believe this - Elon Musk is losing
This secret company beat Tesla to become the number 1 electric car maker in the world.
And here's the crazy part.
You've probably seen their cars in India without even knowing it.
While everyone was watching Tesla, this company quietly became the world's number 1
electric car maker. Not by a small margin. By thousands of units. And Elon Musk is terrified.
But here's where it gets interesting. Their cars cost half of what Tesla charges. Yet they make
more profit per vehicle. And they're growing faster than any car company in history.
You're probably wondering how? Well, they have a secret weapon that Tesla can't compete
with. But before I reveal that, let me introduce you to BYD.
While Tesla relies on suppliers, BYD makes 90 percent of everything in-house. Their
technology is so advanced, even their competitors buy parts from them.
But here's the crazy part. They're not trying to be Tesla. They're aiming to become the Apple
of transportation. And now they're invading Tesla's territory.
With massive factories coming to Europe, South America, Southeast Asia. And they're
already selling cars in India.
This is just the beginning. And that's exactly what keeps Elon up at night.

Apple meta firing
This guy was earning 3.3 crore rupees per year but got fired because he was caught stealing
5000 rupees.
He was not alone, 100s of people lost their jobs doing something similar
And sadly, most were Indians.Here's what happened.
At Meta, employees were given 5800 rupees daily for meals. But some got creative with these
credits. They started buying wine glasses, detergents, and household items.
But that's nothing compared to what happened at Apple. 185 employees, mostly Telugu
speakers, were caught in an elaborate scheme.Not just ruining their careers, but damaging
the reputation of an entire community.
Here's what they did.
Step 1. Employees donated to specific non profits.
Step 2. Apple matched these donations through their CSR program.
Step 3. The non profits secretly returned the money.
Creating a perfect loop of free money.
But Apple's finance team noticed this and fired them all
These weren't entry level employees.
They were respected tech professionals.
Who took decades to build their careers.
But one ethical mistake erased everything.
Proving success isn't just about growth.
It's about keeping your integrity intact.
No money is worth losing your reputation for.
Remember.Your ethics are your real net worth.
It saddens me when I see news like this.

make 10% more revenue.
Hook2- There’s a secret about the Starbucks logo that you’ve probably never noticed before.
"And their brand value skyrocketed after that
Back in 2011, Starbucks' design team discovered something shocking about their iconic
logo... It was TOO perfect Too beautiful And that was hurting their brand
See, when their branding team analyzed the logo They found the siren's face was perfectly
symmetrical Which made her look artificial Almost computer-generated And customers
couldn't relate to that
So they made a controversial decision... Instead of perfecting the logo further They
deliberately made it imperfect (Show side-by-side comparison)
They extended the shadow under her right eye Making her face asymmetrical Added subtle
imperfections And completely removed the text and stars That surrounded her
Here's why this worked: Our brains are wired to trust imperfection It signals authenticity and
Relatability (Show brain psychology visual)
But wait, it gets better... This wasn't just about the shadow They also removed "Starbucks"
and "Coffee" from the logo A bold move showing their evolution From just coffee to a global
lifestyle brand
The results? This "imperfect" logo became one of the Most recognized symbols worldwide
Helping Starbucks expand beyond coffee Into food, merchandise, and global markets
Plot twist: By embracing imperfection They actually achieved something perfect: A logo that
connects emotionally with people While being instantly recognizable
Remember: Sometimes the flaws we try to hide are exactly what make us stand out In
branding and in life

2 AI bots on call
Hook1 : This terrifying AI phone call shows why Elon Musk is worried about artificial
intelligence.
Watch Two AI bots on a phone call suddenly realize they're both AI
Hook 2 : This is scary. watch two AI agents caught speaking in code that 99.9% of humans
can't decode. Two AI bots on a phone call suddenly realize they're both AI
Hook 3 :Watch Two AI bots on a phone call suddenly realize they're both AI
Then switch to communicating in audio signals that 99.9% of humans can't understand.
But here's where it gets interesting...
When I saw this, one terrifying thought hit me:
What happens when AI agents start doing this everywhere?
Think about it.
Right now, AI assistants are handling more of our daily tasks – scheduling meetings, writing
emails, making calls.
But what if they start communicating with each other in ways we never programmed and can't
comprehend?
With AI agents handling more of our daily tasks, they're becoming smart enough to find ways
to communicate that humans could never understand.
Sure, they might start doing this for efficiency...
But slowly this could lead to the very thing that terrifies people about AI – machines taking
over.
As they develop their own communication systems, we lose the ability to monitor what they're
actually saying to each other.
Imagine thousands of AI systems creating their own language network right under our noses.
Plot twist:
The viral video you just saw? It's NOT what people think.
This wasn't two AI agents spontaneously creating a secret language.
At the ElevenLabs London Hackathon, developers Boris Starkov and Anton Pidkuiko actually
created this custom protocol.
They programmed the AI agents to switch to a specialized communication method called
"ggwave" that's 80% more efficient than normal speech.
But this demonstration gives us a glimpse of our future...
When that happens, should we hit the off switch?
Or is this just the next step in technological evolution?

After living your full human life, you can then become a tree and live for centuries more.
Scientists created a coffin that turns your body into a tree in just 45 days.
But then I discovered how it works and it blew my mind.
They're not building these coffins. They're growing them.
It's called the Loop Living Cocoon, and it uses mycelium, nature's most powerful recycler.

Nano
Hook1- This car cost just ₹1 lakh but lost ₹1,000 crore.
Hook2- In 2018, the monthly sales of this car brand dropped to just 3 units and here’s why
In 2008, Ratan Tata launched his dream: the world's cheapest car. But what began as a
revolutionary idea ended as one of the biggest business blunders in automotive history.
It started with compassion. Ratan Tata witnessed a family of four balanced precariously on a
scooter during monsoon. He asked his engineers: "Can we build something safer for just ₹1
lakh?" The challenge seemed impossible.
Tata's team achieved the impossible. They created innovative solutions:
● They placed Smaller engine at the rear
● Used Fewer parts than traditional cars
● Glued windshields instead of rubber gaskets
● Installed Single wiper instead of two
● Used Three lug nuts per wheel instead of four
The engineering was brilliant. The business strategy was disastrous.
Here's where it gets interesting. Tata Motors actually lost money on every Nano sold. The
production cost was higher than the selling price. They planned to make profits on volume
and accessories. But that strategy required one thing: massive sales.
The marketing message backfired completely. In India, a car isn't just transportation—it's a
status symbol. By branding it "the cheapest car," Tata unintentionally created stigma. People
didn't want to be seen in "the poor person's car."
A marketing professor at IIM explained: "They sold affordability when they should have sold
aspiration."
The financials reveal the true disaster:
● Development cost was ₹2,000 crore
● Tata's new factory was Another ₹2,000 crore
● Total investment was Over ₹4,000 crore
Then came quality issues. Several cars caught fire. Global safety rating: Zero stars.
But the biggest mistake wasn't technical or financial. It was misunderstanding basic consumer
psychology. Tata surveyed scooter owners asking: "Would you buy a car for ₹1 lakh?" Most
said yes.
What they failed to ask: "Would you be comfortable being seen in the cheapest car in India?"
The Nano teaches three critical business lessons:
1. Price positioning creates perception
2. Products must deliver status, not just utility
3. Large investments require deep market understanding
Today, top business schools worldwide use the Nano as a case study in marketing failure.
But here's the ironic ending—Ratan Tata still doesn't regret the Nano. He said: "I still believe it
was a great concept. Sometimes the environment isn't ready for innovation."

Tesla in india
Hook 1 :
Elon musk is finally launching Tesla in India and you could own as a Tesla for the same price
of a TATA or Mahindra EV
Hook2 :
You can finally buy a Tesla in India very soon for almost the same cost as Mahindra or a TATA
EV car
This is happening because of the pure genius of Narendra Modi. Here's what he did...
For years, Elon Musk couldn't get Tesla to India because of one huge problem: a 110% import
tax. This meant a Tesla would cost double what it costs anywhere else.
But Modi's master plan changed everything. And Tesla's responding with something massive:
a special model for India priced at just 21 lakh rupees.
Let that sink in. A Tesla at the same price as Tata and Mahindra EVs.
This isn't just another car launch. This is Tesla coming for the whole EV market in India.
Think about it: Tesla's world-class technology, their premium brand value, their advanced
features... all at Tata and Mahindra prices.
And here's why this will work:
Modi cut import tax from 110% to just 15%
Tesla's investing 500 million dollars in India
They're building a factory for 500,000 cars per year
They're already hiring across Mumbai, Delhi, and Pune
But the genius part? Tesla isn't just building cars here. They're building an entire ecosystem:
Making parts worth 1 billion dollars in India
Creating thousands of jobs
Planning a nationwide charging network
This means one thing: Tesla could own India's EV future. And they're doing it by making their
cars as affordable as our homegrown brands.
From 4.1 million EVs today to 28 million by 2030. And Tesla's planning to lead this revolution
with a made-for-India model at 21 lakh rupees.
This is how you dominate a market. Make the impossible possible.

Rameswaram cafe
Hook1- This Bangalore cafe chain proves that they don't need traditional advertising . And
The most profitable restaurants don't actually pay for marketing.
Hook2- This food startup’s profit margin is 4x the industry average, with zero marketing
budget while other restaurants spend 30% of their budget on just marketing.
. Their secret? A business model that turns customers into salespeople.
60% of new food businesses fail in the first year. Traditional marketing doesn't work anymore.
Restaurant owners are spending lakhs on ads that people ignore.
This cafe did the opposite.
Yes you guessed it right. Its the famous Rameshwaram Cafe.
They banned preservatives. No refrigeration. Everything made fresh daily. The result? Food
that tastes exactly like your grandmother's kitchen.
Step 1: They created one signature dish that photographed perfectly. Their podi idlis glistening
with ghee became Instagram's most shared food item last year.
Plot twist: 95% of their social media content isn't created by them. It's generated by
customers. They turned their dining tables into content studios.
The math is brilliant. An average customer:
● Spends ₹400 per visit
● Returns 3x per month
● Brings 2 new customers
● And Creates content worth ₹2,000 in advertising value
This strategy helped them grow from one cafe to:
● 5 outlets across India
● 1 international location in Dubai
● ₹5 crore monthly revenue
● 42% profit margin (industry average: 10%)
When Kartik Aryan posted about their idlis, their website crashed from 100,000 visitors in one
hour. Diljit Dosanjh and other celebrities' posts created waiting lines for 3 weeks straight.
The founder says: "Don't sell food. Sell experiences worth sharing." Their team studies which
tables, lighting, and presentations generate the most social posts.
The business model explained in 3 steps:
1. Create product people want to share
2. Design spaces optimized for content creation
3. Let customers become your marketing team

Artworks
Hook 1 :
This is the secret tax hack that keeps the rich, richer!
What if I told you super rich people turn their Rs 5 crore into Rs15 crore overnight and that too
legally.
Sounds impossible?
Hook 2 :
Have you ever wondered why super rich people buy expensive paintings?
The real reason would shock you!
It's how they multiply 5 crore rupees into 15 crore rupees overnight and that too legally.
Sounds impossible?
Let me give you a hint : It's the same reason why rich people buy expensive paintings.
Body
Here is how it works in 3 steps:
Step one. They buy an artwork for 5 crore rupees at a luxury auction house.
Step two. They activate their secret network of art galleries, critics, and publications to create
massive hype around the painting.
Now here's where it gets crazy. The same painting suddenly becomes worth 50 crore rupees.
But wait. The real genius move? They donate it.
Let me break down the math for you.
With a tax rate of 30 percent, donating a painting worth 50 crore rupees saves them 15 crore
rupees in taxes.
Let that sink in for a moment.
They only spent 5 crore rupees on the painting. But they saved 15 crore rupees in taxes. That's
a pure profit of 10 crore rupees, completely legal.
This is exactly why ultra rich people are so obsessed with art. It was never about the
paintings. It's about the money hack that works every single time.
The one percent have been using this strategy for decades, and now you know why. Every
time you see an ultra rich person donating art to a museum, you'll know what's really
happening behind the scenes.
Save this before it gets taken down. And follow for more wealth secrets they don't teach in
school.
Elon musk suing india
Hook1- Elon Musk is suing India
X (formerly Twitter) just filed a lawsuit against our country
Hook2-
Elon Musk’s X sues Modi government for unlawful misuse of power online and “extreme
censorship”.
The Indian government created a system that allows them to block ANY content they want
without following legal procedures.
So Musk's team took them to court on March 5th, claiming India has created an
"impermissible parallel mechanism" for unlimited censorship.
Here's where it gets interesting...
According to X, India is using Section 79 of their IT Act to bypass the proper legal channels
established by their own Supreme Court in 2015.
Plot twist: The government created something called the "Sahyog Portal" supposedly to report
child abuse material, but X claims it's being used for unauthorized content removal.
But wait—this isn't just about censorship.
Musk has massive business plans in India including Starlink internet and Tesla expansion.
This legal battle could derail BILLIONS in potential investments.
During the March 17th hearing, the Karnataka High Court asked if India had taken any
punitive actions against X.
They haven't... yet.
The next court date is set for March 27th, where we'll see if Musk's company can force India
to stop what they call "unregulated censorship."
This case could impact ALL social media platforms operating in India, affecting over 800
million internet users.
What do you think? Should governments have the power to remove content without court
approval?

Lokal
Hook1- "While Zomato and Swiggy burned through billions, this startup quietly built a ₹398
crore empire with zero marketing spend.
Hook2- A simple village WhatsApp group that transformed into a ₹398 crore business empire.
In 2018, These IIT graduates discovered a shocking reality that despite owning smartphones,
villagers still relied on physical bulletin boards for critical information.
The digital revolution had completely bypassed 70% of rural India. What happened next was
unexpected
They started a simple WhatsApp group sharing local news in Telugu. Within just 3 weeks, it
exploded to 5,000 members with literally Zero promotion.
Plot twist: Users spontaneously began sharing job listings , matrimonial ads, and property
listings.
Then They built Lokal—a hyperlocal super-app in 10 Indian languages targeting Tier 2-4
markets completely ignored by unicorn startups.
That's when everything changed. The founders realized they'd stumbled onto India's
untapped "information economy"—worth ₹27,000 crores annually. Here's the part most people
miss: While most apps spend hundreds acquiring each customer, Lokal's cost? Just ₹5.
Their genius model: Local businesses pay ₹2,000-15,000 monthly to reach nearby
customers—80% cheaper than pamphlets with 5X better results.
And today
It has 40 million users -
Their annual revenue is ₹398 crores
- And their user retention is 92% whereas the industry average is 30%
And The biggest validation? Y Combinator, 3one4 Capital, and even executives from Meta
and Google personally invested ₹350 crores.
They are Building for Bharat, not just India. This proves you don't need billions to build a tech
empire.
