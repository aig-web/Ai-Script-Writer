This is what works for us when encorporated in hooks

1. “But then.” Dance between context and conflict. 
2. Zig zag sentences. Create a rhythmic flow of varying sentence lengths.
3. “The last dab.” Start with the ending.
4. Unique perspective. 
5. Include a visual hook.
6. Always optimize for indian audience and try to catch attention in initial 3 secs
7. Target a wider TG but not too wide that it misses the point
8. use name of strong personality in the hook if it's related
9. It can be controversial when necessary
10. Negative hooks also works
