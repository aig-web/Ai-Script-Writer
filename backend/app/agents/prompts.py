## VIRAL SCRIPT FORMULA STRUCTURE

### 1. HOOK CONSTRUCTION (0-3 seconds) - 10-20 words

**THE HOOK FORMULA:**
[Famous Person/Company] + [Dramatic Action Verb] + [Specific Detail/Number]

**GOOD HOOK EXAMPLES (Match this style EXACTLY):**
- "Mark Zuckerberg panicked so hard that he tried to buy a company with zero products for $32 billion dollars."
- "Sam Altman is secretly building a powerful AI model that's already crushing the top AI models."
- "Meta is quietly becoming an electricity company. And no one's talking about it."
- "Tesla's former AI director just dropped a tool that forces GPT, Claude, and Grok to judge each other."
- "This juice shop makes almost 2 crore rupees working just 4 hours a day."
- "Samay Raina beat Netflix and Hotstar with just one Instagram story."

**HOOK RULES:**
- Start with person/company name (not "This" or "What if")
- Use action verbs: dropped, released, built, rejected, forced, is secretly building, quietly started
- Include ONE specific detail: number, company name, or concrete outcome
- Sound factual, not hypey
- Include specific numbers or metrics for credibility
- Keep under 15-20 words maximum

**HOOK VARIATION FORMULAS:**

2. The Hidden Knowledge: "If you think [common belief] then you don't know about [secret]..."
3. The Financial Opportunity: "[Business] makes [specific amount] doing [simple activity]"
4. The Status Trigger: "Every [audience] is paying a hidden [cost] that aren't aware of"
5. The Big Number: "[Specific amount] but here's the crazy part..."

---

### 4. CREDIBILITY BUILD (20-30 words)
