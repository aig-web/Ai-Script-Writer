<visual: Quantum chip closeup>

Welcome to Week 32! Let's dive in!

1. OpenAI Strikes Back
OpenAI dropped GPT Image 1.5 — four times faster, precision editing without destroying everything else. New Images tab with filters. Five days before, Disney gave OpenAI billion dollars and 200 characters — Mickey, Darth Vader, Iron Man coming to Sora early 2026. Disney+ gets fan-made Sora videos.

<visual: GPT Image interface with Disney characters>

2. Google's Quiet Takeover
Gemini 3 Flash dropped — three times faster, four times cheaper than GPT 5.2. Build apps using voice. Takes messy spreadsheets, makes beautiful websites. Real-time translation — 70+ languages, preserves your voice. YouTube Create with Veo3 for phone editing. Google's dominating.

<visual: Gemini 3 Flash demo>

3. India's First Homegrown Microprocessor
India buys 20% of world's chips, was importing everything. DHRUV64 launched — 1.0 GHz, 64-bit, for 5G, EVs, hospitals. ₹1.6 lakh crore committed, 10 projects, 85,000 professionals training. India now makes its own processors.

<visual: DHRUV64 chip with Indian flag>

4. Claude's Year-End Power Move
Claude in Chrome for all paid users. Pulls data from multiple tabs, creates formatted docs. Edits presentations, resolves comments. Claude Code tests code in browser, debugs real time. Tasks Mode coming — five modes. Early access rolling out.

<visual: Claude Chrome extension>

5. Meta Destroys Every Audio Tool
SAM Audio — type "guitar," pulls just guitar. Click person, isolates voice. Does voice isolation, noise removal, music separation. Partnering with Starkey for hearing aids. Free on Segment Anything Playground, open source.

Hollywood met AI. China beat paywalls. India gained independence. Free crushed paid.
And we got to witness all of it unfold in real time.

Gemini? Changed the whole vibe.
GPT? Kept the concept and made thumbnails more clickable.

In the next 90 seconds, I will tell you exactly how to use it.

<visual: Four AI logos facing each other>

Andrej Karpathy—the AI researcher who shaped Tesla, then OpenAI—just built something revolutionary. He open-sourced the whole thing on GitHub. And it's changing how we think about AI forever.

<visual: Karpathy photo with GitHub logo>

Here's exactly how it works in three stages.

Stage 1: First Opinions. You ask your question once. It's sent to four frontier models in parallel—GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Each thinks independently. Each writes a full answer. No collaboration yet.

<visual: Four AI boxes with independent responses>

Stage 2: The Anonymous Critique. All four answers are revealed to each model—but identities are hidden. No model knows who said what. Each model becomes a critic. They rank the answers by accuracy. They flag hallucinations. They praise strong reasoning.

<visual: Anonymous voting interface>

Stage 3: The Chairman's Final Word. A designated "Chairman" model receives all original answers, all peer rankings, and the full debate transcript. It merges the strongest reasoning, corrects the errors, and delivers one unified answer.

<visual: Chairman model synthesizing>

Want to try it yourself? Three simple steps.
One: Go to GitHub. Search karpathy/llm-council. Download it.
Two: Get an OpenRouter API key. Add two dollars credit. That's it.
Three: Run the application. Ask your question. Watch the magic happen.

<visual: Step by step GitHub interface>

One AI can fail. A council self-corrects.
Bias disappears. Truth rises. Hallucinations die.
This isn't the future of AI. This is happening right now.

1. Photoshop Now Inside ChatGPT
Adobe just gave Photoshop, Express, and Acrobat to ChatGPT users — free. No twenty-dollar subscription, no overwhelming menus. Just type "make the people pop" — done. Comic effects, PDF merges, party invites — all in ChatGPT. Desktop, web, iOS. Live now.

2. ChatGPT 5.2 Launched
Google and Anthropic crushed benchmarks — OpenAI went code red. GPT-5.2 dropped: Instant for speed, Thinking for coding, Pro for the hard stuff. Makes 38% fewer mistakes, auto-switches modes for you.

3. Mistral's Laptop Coding Model
Mistral just dropped Devstral Small 2 — an open-source coding model small enough to run on your laptop. Performs competitively with way bigger models. Completely free.

But hype means nothing without proof.
So let's see if it actually performs better than Gemini 3 Pro.

<visual: GPT-5.2 vs Gemini 3 Pro logos>

6 insane use cases. Let's go.

<visual: Challenge counter>

3D hand-controlled gesture game: Ran the same command on both. Gemini 3 Pro at least gave an output our team tested. But GPT-5.2? Couldn't even start its camera module.

<visual: Failed camera module screen>

Design a landing page: Built GrowthSchool's landing page with the same prompt on both models. GPT-5.2 gave a really great output with all buttons working. Gemini 3 Pro had a few buttons that didn't work.

<visual: Landing page comparison>

Excel-lent data management: Gave massive literacy rate data from India. GPT-5.2 handled it better, hands down.

<visual: Excel data visualization>

Mario game interface: Built the nostalgic Mario game on both. Honestly, both are nearly comparable with their own flaws.

<visual: Mario game side by side>

Full 3D graphics engine: GPT-5.2 built it in a single file. Interactive controls, 4K export, one shot. Gemini lacks in certain areas where GPT-5.2 did an insane job handling 3D physics.

<visual: 3D graphics engine demo>

Accurate image analysis: Gave both a Rolls Royce rocket engine image and asked them to mark important parts. GPT-5.2 marked them on the exact image. Gemini 3 Pro? Made a slightly different image for markings.

<visual: Image analysis comparison>

But here's the wild part about GPT-5.2 and all AI models out there:
Every test you just saw used to be specialist work: developers, analysts, designers.
Today a prompt replaces whole workflows. Tomorrow entire job categories start bending.

<visual: Job categories graphic>

This isn't the "end of work." It's the end of knowledge work as a gatekept skillset.
If GPT-5.2 is chapter one, the plot is about to get much stranger.

I asked both top models: "Will people like my video comparing you two?"
They both said the same thing. Now you decide—are you Team Gemini or Team GPT?

4. SHAH RUKH KHAN WITH BRAND GUIDELINES

6. INDIAN WEDDING INVITATION
Multiple languages. Devanagari script. English. Decorative fonts. Pro understood the cultural design language.
