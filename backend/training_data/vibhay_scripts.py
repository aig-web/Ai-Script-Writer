<visual: Four AI logos facing each other>

Andrej Karpathy—the AI researcher who shaped Tesla, then OpenAI—just built something revolutionary. He open-sourced the whole thing on GitHub. And it's changing how we think about AI forever.

<visual: Karpathy photo with GitHub logo>

Here's exactly how it works in three stages.

Stage 1: First Opinions. You ask your question once. It's sent to four frontier models in parallel—GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Each thinks independently. Each writes a full answer. No collaboration yet.

<visual: Four AI boxes with independent responses>

Stage 2: The Anonymous Critique. All four answers are revealed to each model—but identities are hidden. No model knows who said what. Each model becomes a critic. They rank the answers by accuracy. They flag hallucinations. They praise strong reasoning.

<visual: Anonymous voting interface>

Stage 3: The Chairman's Final Word. A designated "Chairman" model receives all original answers, all peer rankings, and the full debate transcript. It merges the strongest reasoning, corrects the errors, and delivers one unified answer.

<visual: Chairman model synthesizing>

Want to try it yourself? Three simple steps.
One: Go to GitHub. Search karpathy/llm-council. Download it.
Two: Get an OpenRouter API key. Add two dollars credit. That's it.
Three: Run the application. Ask your question. Watch the magic happen.

<visual: Step by step GitHub interface>

One AI can fail. A council self-corrects.
Bias disappears. Truth rises. Hallucinations die.
This isn't the future of AI. This is happening right now.

6 insane use cases. Let's go.

3D hand-controlled gesture game: Ran the same command on both. Gemini 3 Pro at least gave an output our team tested. But GPT-5.2? Couldn't even start its camera module.

Design a landing page: Built GrowthSchool's landing page with the same prompt on both models. GPT-5.2 gave a really great output with all buttons working. Gemini 3 Pro had a few buttons that didn't work.

Excel-lent data management: Gave massive literacy rate data from India. GPT-5.2 handled it better, hands down.

Mario game interface: Built the nostalgic Mario game on both. Honestly, both are nearly comparable with their own flaws.

Full 3D graphics engine: GPT-5.2 built it in a single file. Interactive controls, 4K export, one shot. Gemini lacks in certain areas where GPT-5.2 did an insane job handling 3D physics.

Accurate image analysis: Gave both a Rolls Royce rocket engine image and asked them to mark important parts. GPT-5.2 marked them on the exact image. Gemini 3 Pro? Made a slightly different image for markings.

The psychology behind this? Pure genius.

His show is already crushing it with 20 million views per episode. Why? Because he does what TV networks won't. Poonam Pandey as judge, Rakhi Sawant uncensored, guests TV channels wouldn't dare touch - pure, raw, unfiltered content.

So when he simply posted "Hey, dropped an app for the show," people went crazy. They knew what that meant: if the YouTube show is this spicy, imagine what's in the app's exclusive section.

This isn't random. It's called the Velvet Rope Effect.

Within 24 hours, he hit number one on the App Store. No marketing campaigns. No promotions. Just one story.

Look at the contrast:
Netflix begs "Please download our app"
Hotstar shouts "We have IPL!"
Samay just whispers "Want more Latent?"

Boom. Number one.

The psychological masterpiece? Three triggers:
People were already addicted to the free content
He promised exclusive access
He created FOMO without even trying

While others spend millions on marketing, he made his free show so good that people are fighting to pay for more. All he had to say was "app's live."

Hired their top talent.
Took their market share.

Ambani wasn't failing.
He was feasting.

Need proof?
Dunzo went from 2000 to just 50 employees.
All founders resigned.
18 months of unpaid salaries.

Meanwhile. JioMart?

Second, build PULL, not PUSH. Trust matters more than marketing budgets.
Third, customer trust compounds. They turned Rs.140 crores into Rs.3000 crores in just 4 years!

Their 'inconvenient' locations made them a $44 billion empire.

IKEA's store locations aren't random - they're actually genius.

Most companies fight for prime city locations, but IKEA does the opposite.

The average IKEA store sits 45 minutes from city centers, surrounded by nothing but parking lots and highways.

This isn't a cost-cutting move - it's actually brilliant psychology. Here's how it works...

When you invest time and gas money to reach an IKEA, your brain activates something called the 'sunk cost fallacy'.

Your mind thinks: 'I've already spent so much effort getting here, I need to make this trip worth it.'

This makes you more likely to fill your cart with items you weren't planning to buy.

But here's where IKEA's strategy gets even smarter...

They build massive showrooms in these locations - typically 300,000 square feet. The extra space costs way less because land is cheaper outside cities.

This means they can create entire room displays, letting you imagine the furniture in your home, making you more likely to purchase.

The result? IKEA's psychological strategy helped them build a $44 billion empire - by making their stores harder to reach.

But here's where it gets crazy.

While everyone said EVs would fail, this 740kg Indian car was already in 26 countries. Had over 1000 units in London alone. And cost less than a Tesla's down payment.

But who built it?

Chetan Maini, A young Indian engineer behind it spent 7 years developing this car. When the world thought EVs were impossible.

Can you guess the name of the company?

Its REVA. India's first EV revolution that shocked the auto industry.

Fun fact. I actually rode in one as a kid in Bangalore. It felt magical, this tiny silent car gliding through the streets.

And guess what? You can still spot these pioneers on Bangalore's lanes today!

The craziest part?

Mahindra bought the company in 2010. Making it India's first successful EV startup. Before startups were even a thing!

The crazy part, very soon for just 600 rupees you can travel from Kolkata to Chennai in just 3 hours.

Imagine flying just above water to travel from Kolkata to Chennai for just Rs 600 in just 3 hours. That's the cost of a movie ticket and popcorn!

But wait - these aren't boats or planes. They're "seagliders" that fly just 4 meters above water using something called ground effect.

Think of it as surfing on air cushions at speeds up to 500 km per hour!

It also aims to offer ZERO carbon travel. By offering zero-carbon travel options, these innovative vehicles not only reduce environmental impact but also provide a compelling alternative to traditional modes of transport.

The craziest part?

Anand Mahindra himself is hyping them up, calling the design "stunning" and praising IIT Madras for rivaling Silicon Valley in nurturing this startup.

You're probably thinking this is just another fancy concept that'll never happen, right? Wrong!

They already have a working prototype and by April 2025, a 100 kg version will be ready. By 2026, they'll have a full 20-seater glider in operation.

These electric seagliders don't just work over water. They can fly over ice, deserts - basically any flat surface without obstacles.

Military? Interested. Cargo companies? Interested. Regular travelers? Very interested.

The real game-changer comes by 2029 when they plan to open intercontinental routes. Imagine flying from Dubai to Los Angeles in one of these!

At just Rs 600 per seat for a journey that would cost thousands by plane, these seagliders could completely transform how we think about coastal travel.

Is this the future of transportation we've been waiting for?

Here is the wild part.

A massive 2200 square foot villa, created by a printer.

Think of a giant robotic arm, moving with millimeter precision, laying down concrete layer by layer.

The company behind this? A 3 crore rupee startup called Tvasta, founded by three IIT graduates.

But here is where it gets interesting.

They created a special concrete mix using industrial waste.

And the results? Mind blowing.

They finished the entire villa in just 4 months.
With zero construction waste.
And the homes use 50 percent less energy.

No one believed it was possible.

Even Godrej, one of India's biggest real estate giants, challenged them to prove it.

This house? This was their answer.

You see, traditional construction in India has a massive problem.
30 percent of materials go to waste.
Projects face endless delays.
And costs? They just keep rising.

But now, major real estate companies are lining up to work with Tvasta.

And this is exactly why I am sharing this with you today.

There is a massive business opportunity here.

Construction is a trillion dollar industry.
And it is desperate for innovation.

Think about this.
India needs millions of new homes every year.
And there is space in the market for not just one.
But one hundred such companies.

This is not just about one startup anymore.
This is about transforming how India builds.

The opportunity is wide open.

By 2026, your next home might not be built.
It might be printed. And you could be printing it.

If you think you need a fancy degree to build a billion-dollar company, this peon's story will shock you.

You're not gonna believe this story... See, back in the 1950s, there was this guy named Balvant Parekh.

Here's where it gets interesting... Every day, he'd watch carpenters struggle with these messy animal-based glues. They'd have to heat it up, It was super inconvenient, And Most vegetarians wouldn't even touch it.

Now, most people would just ignore this problem. But Balvant? He saw an opportunity that EVERYONE else missed.

Instead of accepting things as they were, he teamed up with his brother and started experimenting.

In 1959, they launched something revolutionary: Fevicol - a ready-to-use synthetic adhesive.

But wait, the genius wasn't just the product... It was what they did next.

Instead of going to fancy stores, They went straight to the carpenters. Showed them how it worked. Made them brand ambassadors without spending a rupee.

The results? MIND-BLOWING.

Today, Fevicol is so popular in India, People don't say "pass the adhesive" They say "pass the Fevicol" even when it's not a fevicol.

This is called "Brand genericization" And That's how you know you've made it!

And that peon everyone underestimated? His company now controls 70% of India's adhesive market. Worth ₹650 billion!

But here's the real lesson. Success doesn't care about your job title. It cares about your ability to solve problems.

Balvant didn't just sell glue... He solved a problem that affected millions.

So next time you notice something annoying in your daily life...

It has the ability to eradicate dangerous diseases like malaria.

Scientists are now releasing these genetically modified insects worldwide. But then I discovered the surprising truth.

Every year, mosquitoes kill more humans than sharks, snakes, and people combined. They're Earth's deadliest animal. And they're winning.

Plot twist. These lab-created mutants are actually our secret weapon.

Here's where it gets interesting.

Scientists engineered male mosquitoes with a self-destruct gene that gets passed to their offspring.

And since only female mosquitoes bite and spread disease, when these modified males mate, their female offspring can't survive to adulthood.

The results are mind-blowing.

In Brazil, mosquito populations dropped 90 percent in treated areas.
Dengue fever cases plummeted almost immediately.

Now you might have heard wild theories about secret vaccines, population control, or government tracking.

But here's the truth.

After 10 years of research, scientists found these mosquitoes cause no harm to humans, create no environmental damage, and dramatically reduce deadly diseases.

The technology is transforming how we fight humanity's oldest killer.

Scientists believe this approach could potentially end malaria, stop dengue fever, and save millions of lives each year.

But wait. The company behind this is now expanding releases to cities across America, Asia, and Africa.

Would you want these mutant mosquitoes released in your neighborhood?

Everyone orders BroCode thinking it's beer. That's exactly what they wanted.

Look closely at their bottle. Something's hidden in plain sight.

BroCode isn't beer at all. It's wine packaged as beer. With 15 percent alcohol, that's three times stronger than regular beer.

They also make sure it is placed next to beer instead of wine so that perception stays as beer.

But wait, it gets better.

On every bottle, they wrote Kraft Sekt. That's German for Craft Wine. They never even lied about it.

Here's the genius part. In India, beer gets taxed two times more than wine.

So by selling wine as beer, they pay half the taxes while everyone thinks they're drinking beer.

This one move by BroCode created India's favorite party drink, saved crores in taxes, and stayed completely legal.

The app launched on an Indian festival day and went global instantly by offering what the wellness industry doesn't: simplicity and zero cost. Just 7 minutes of guided meditation with no subscriptions, no ads, and no upsells.

The app is Miracle of Mind, created by Sadhguru of Isha Foundation. When he announced, "Here's a tool for your mind," people worldwide responded immediately.

Within 15 hours, it trended in over 20 countries across multiple continents without marketing campaigns or celebrity endorsements.

The contrast is striking: Headspace demands "$12.99 monthly," Calm sells "Celebrity sleep stories," while Sadhguru simply offered "7 minutes to miracle."

His success comes from addressing the global mental health crisis, removing all barriers with a free multilingual app, and providing AI-powered insights without complexity.

Business leaders praise it for improving productivity, while users love its intuitive design that encourages consistent practice.

Hindustan Motors is investing a massive ₹600 crore in development to ensure this comeback isn't just about nostalgia – it's about creating India's next automotive icon.

Production will happen at the Chennai plant, with prices expected between ₹10-15 lakh.
